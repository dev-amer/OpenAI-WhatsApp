When this\nknowledge is incorporated in your consciousness, it will give you the ability to create unlimited\nwealth with effortless ease, and to experience success in every endeavour.\nSuccess in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progres-\nsive realization of worthy goals. Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease.\nAnd yet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to be a process\nthat requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at the expense of others. We need a\nmore  spiritual  approach  to  success  and  to  affluence,  which  is  the  abundant  flow  of  all  good\nthings to you. With the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmony\nwith nature and create with carefulness, joy, and love.\nThere  are  many  aspects  to  success;  material  wealth  is  only  one  component.  Moreover,\nsuccess is a journey, not a destination. Material abundance, in all its expressions, happens to be\none  of  those  things  that  makes  the  journey  more  enjoyable.  But  success  also  includes  good\nhealth, energy and enthusiasm for life, fulfilling relationships, creative freedom, emotional and\npsychological stability, a sense of well-being, and peace of mind.\nEven with the experience of all these things, we will remain unfulfilled unless we nurture the\nseeds of divinity inside us. In reality, we are divinity in disguise, and the gods and goddesses in\nembryo that are contained within us seek to be fully materialized. True success is therefore the\nexperience of the miraculous. It is the unfolding of the divinity within us. It is the perception of\ndivinity wherever we go, in whatever we perceive ó in the eyes of a child, in the beauty of a\nflower, in the flight of a bird. When we begin to experience our life as the miraculous expression\nof divinity ó not occasionally, but all the time ó then we will know the true meaning of success.\nBefore defining the seven spiritual laws, let us understand the concept of law. Law is the\nprocess by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest; itís the process by which the observer\nbecomes the observed; itís the process by which the seer becomes the scenery; itís the process\nthrough which the dreamer manifests the dream.\nAll of creation, everything that exists in the physical world, is the result of the unmanifest\ntransforming itself into the manifest. Everything that we behold comes from the unknown. Our\nphysical body, the physical universe ó anything and everything that we can perceive through\nour senses ó is the transformation of the unmanifest, unknown, and invisible into the manifest,\nknown, and visible.\nThe physical universe is nothing other than the Self curving back within Itself to experience\nItself as spirit, mind, and physical matter. In other words, all processes of creation are processes\nthrough which the Self or divinity expresses Itself. Consciousness in motion expresses itself as\nthe objects of the universe in the eternal dance of life.\nThe  source  of  all  creation  is  divinity  (or  the  spirit);  the  process  of  creation  is  divinity  in\nmotion  (or  the  mind);  and  the  object  of  creation  is  the  physical  universe  (which  includes  the\nphysical body).","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":52}}}}],["4",{"pageContent":"These three components of reality ó spirit, mind, and body, or observer, the process of\nobserving, and the observed ó are essentially the same thing. They all come from the same\nplace: the field of pure potentiality which is purely unmanifest.\nThe physical laws of the universe are actually this whole process of divinity in motion, or\nconsciousness in motion. When we understand these laws and apply them in our lives, anything\nwe want can be created, because the same laws that nature uses to create a forest, or a galaxy,\nor a star, or a human body can also bring about the fulfillment of our deepest desires.\nNow letís go over \nThe Seven Spiritual Laws of Success\n and see how we can apply them in\nour lives.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":11}}}}],["5",{"pageContent":"1\nThe law of pure\npotentiality","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":3}}}}],["6",{"pageContent":"The source of all creation is pure consciousness, pure potentiality seeking expression from\nthe unmanifest to the manifest.\nAnd when we realise that our true Self is one of pure potentiality, we align with the power\nthat manifests everything in the universe.\nIn  the  beginning  there  was  neither  existence\nnor non-existence,\nAll this world was unmanifest energy . . .\nThe One breathed, without breath, by Its own\npower Nothing else was there . . .\nó Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda\nT\nhe first spiritual law of success is the Law \nof Pure Potentiality.\n This law is based on\nthe fact that we are, in our essential state, pure consciousness. Pure consciousness\nis pure potentiality; it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity. Pure con-\nsciousness  is  our  spiritual  essence.  Being  infinite  and  unbounded,  it  is  also  pure  joy.  Other\nattributes of consciousness are pure knowledge, infinite silence, perfect balance, invincibility,\nsimplicity, and bliss. This is our essential nature. Our essential nature is one of pure potentiality.\nWhen you discover your essential nature and know who you really are, in \nthat knowing\nitself  is\n  the  ability  to  fulfill  any  dream  you  have,  because  you  are  the  eternal  possibility,  the\nimmeasurable potential of all that was, is, and will be. The \nLaw of Pure Potentiality\n could also be\ncalled the \nLaw of Unity,\n because underlying the infinite diversity of life is the unity of one all-\npervasive spirit. There is no separation between you and this field of energy. The field of pure\npotentiality is your own Self. And the more you experience your true nature, the closer you are\nto the field of pure potentiality.\nThe experience of the Self, or ìself-referral,î means that our internal reference point is our\nown spirit, and not the objects of our experience. The opposite of self-referral is object-referral.\nIn object-referral we are always influenced by objects outside the Self, which include situations,\ncircumstances, people, and things. In object-referral we are constantly seeking the approval of\nothers. Our thinking and our behaviour are always in anticipation of a response. It is therefore\nfear-based.\nIn object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for\nexternal power. The need for approval, the need to control things, and the need for external\npower are needs that are based on fear. This kind of power is not the power of pure potentiality,\nor the power of the Self, or \nreal\n power. When we experience the power of the Self, there is an\nabsence  of  fear,  there  is  no  compulsion  to  control,  and  no  struggle  for  approval  or  external\npower.\nIn object-referral, your internal reference point is your ego. The ego, however, is not who\nyou really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing.\nYour social mask thrives on approval. It wants to control, and it is sustained by power, because\nit lives in fear.\nYour  true  Self,  which  is  your  spirit,  your  soul,  is  ^completely  free  of  those  things.  It  is\nimmune to criticism, it is unfearful of any challenge, and it feels beneath no one. And yet, it is\nalso humble and feels superior to no one, because it recognizes that everyone else is the same\nSelf, the same spirit in different disguises.\nThe  law  of  pure  potentiality\n∂7","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":56}}}}],["7",{"pageContent":"Thatís the essential difference between object-referral and self-referral. In self-referral, you\nexperience your true being, which is unfearful of any challenge, has respect for all people, and\nfeels beneath no one. Self-power is therefore true power.\nPower based on object-referral, however, is false power. Being ego-based power, it lasts\nonly  as  long  as  the  object  of  reference  is  there.  If  you  have  a  certain  title  ó  if  youíre  the\npresident of the country or the chairman of a corporation ó or if you have a lot of money, the\npower you enjoy goes with the title, with the job, with the money. Ego-based power will only\nlast as long as those things last. As soon as the title, the job, the money go away, so does the\npower.\nSelf-power, on the other hand, is permanent, because it is based on the knowledge of the\nSelf. And there are certain characteristics of self-power.\nIt draws people to you, and it also draws things that you want to you. It magnetizes people,\nsituations, and circumstances to support your desires. This is also called support from the laws\nof nature. It is the support of divinity; it is the support that comes from being in the state of\ngrace. Your power is such that you enjoy a bond with people, and people enjoy a bond with\nyou. Your power is that of bonding ó a bonding that comes from true love.\nHow can we apply the \nLaw of Pure Potentiality, \nthe field of all possibilities, to our lives? If\nyou want to enjoy the benefits of the field of pure potentiality, if you want to make full use of the\ncreativity which is inherent in pure consciousness, then you have to have access to it. One way\nto access the field is through the daily practice of silence, meditation, and non-judgment. Spending\ntime in nature will also give you access to the qualities inherent in the field: infinite creativity,\nfreedom, and bliss.\nPracticing silence means making a commitment to take a certain amount of time to simply\nBe.  Experiencing  silence  means  periodically  withdrawing  from  the  activity  of  speech.  It  also\nmeans periodically withdrawing from such activities as watching television, listening to the ra-\ndio, or reading a book. If you never give yourself the opportunity to experience silence, this\ncreates turbulence in your internal dialogue.\nSet aside a little time every once in a while to experience silence. Or simply make a com-\nmitment to maintain silence for a certain period each day. You could do it for two hours, or if\nthat seems a lot, do it for a one-hour period. And every once in a while experience silence for\nan extended period of time, such as a full day, or two days, or even a whole week.\nWhat happens when you go into this experience of silence? Initially your internal dialogue\nbecomes even more turbulent. You feel an intense need to say things. Iíve known people who\ngo absolutely crazy the first day or two when they commit themselves to an extended period of\nsilence. A sense of urgency and anxiety suddenly comes over them. But as they stay with the\nexperience, their internal dialogue begins to quieten. And soon the silence becomes profound.\nThis is because after a while the mind gives up; it realizes there is no point in going around and\naround if you ó the Self, the spirit, the choice-maker ó are not going to speak, period. Then,\nas  the  internal  dialogue  quietens,  you  begin  to  experience  the  stillness  of  the  field  of  pure\npotentiality.\nPracticing silence periodically as it is convenient to you is one way to experience the \nLaw\nof Pure Potentiality.\n Spending time each day in meditation is another. Ideally, you should medi-\ntate at least thirty minutes in the morning, and thirty minutes in the evening. Through medita-\ntion you will learn to experience the field of pure silence and pure awareness. In that field of\npure silence is the field of infinite correlation, the field of infinite organizing power, the ultimate\nground of creation where everything is inseparably connected with everything else.\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂ 8","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":52}}}}],["8",{"pageContent":"In the fifth spiritual law, the \nLaw of Intention and Desire,\n you will see how you can intro-\nduce a faint impulse of intention in this field, and the creation of your desires will come about\nspontaneously. But first, you have to experience stillness. Stillness is the first requirement for\nmanifesting your desires, because in stillness lies your connection to the field of pure potentiality\nthat can orchestrate an infinity of details for you.\nImagine throwing a little stone into a still pond and watching it ripple. Then, after a while,\nwhen the ripples settle down, perhaps you throw another little stone. Thatís exactly what you\ndo when you go into the field of pure silence and introduce your intention. In this silence, even\nthe faintest intention will ripple across the underlying ground of universal consciousness, which\nconnects everything with everything else. But, if you do not experience stillness in conscious-\nness, if your mind is like a turbulent ocean, you could throw the Empire State Building into it,\nand you wouldnít notice a thing. In the Bible is \nthe\n expression, ìBe still, and know that I am\nGod.î This can only be accomplished through meditation.\nAnother way to access the field of pure potentiality is through the practice of non-judg-\nment. Judgment is the constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When you\nare constantly evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create a lot of turbulence in your\ninternal dialogue. This turbulence constricts the flow of energy between you and the field of\npure potentiality. You literally squeeze the ìgapî between thoughts.\nThe gap is your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It is that state of pure aware-\nness, that silent space between thoughts, that inner stillness that connects you to true power.\nAnd when you squeeze the gap, you squeeze your connection to the field of pure potentiality\nand infinite creativity.\nThere  is  a  prayer  in  A  Course  in  Miracles  that  states,  ìToday  I  shall  judge  nothing  that\noccurs.î Non-judgment creates silence in your mind. It is a good idea, therefore, to begin your\nday with that statement. And throughout the day, remind yourself of that statement each time\nyou catch yourself judging. If practicing this procedure for the whole day seems too difficult,\nthen you may simply say to yourself, ìFor the next two hours, I wonít judge anything,î or ìFor\nthe next hour, I will experience non-judgment.î Then you can extend it gradually.\nThrough silence, through meditation, and through non-judgment, you will access the first\nlaw, the \nLaw of Pure Potentiality.\n Once you start doing that, you can add a fourth component\nto this practice, and that is regularly spending time in direct communion with nature. Spending\ntime in nature enables you to sense the harmonious interaction of all the elements and forces of\nlife, and gives you a sense of unity with all of life. Whether it be a stream, a forest, a mountain,\na lake, or the seashore, that connection with natureís intelligence will also help you access the\nfield of pure potentiality.\nYou must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence\nis beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge.\nIt is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment.\nAccess to your true essence will also give you insight into the mirror of relationship, be-\ncause all relationship is a reflection of your relationship with yourself. For example, if you have\nguilt, fear, and insecurity over money, or success, or anything else, then these are reflections of\nguilt, fear, and insecurity as basic aspects of your personality. No amount of money or success\nwill solve these basic problems of existence; only intimacy with the Self will bring about true\nhealing. And when you are grounded in the knowledge of your true Self ó when you really\nunderstand your true nature ó you will never feel guilty, fearful, or insecure about money, or\naffluence,  or  fulfilling  your  desires,  because  you  will  realize  that  the  essence  of  all  material\nwealth is life energy, it is pure potentiality. And pure potentiality is your intrinsic nature.\n9\nThe  law  of  pure  potentiality\n∂","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":56}}}}],["9",{"pageContent":"As you gain more and more access to your true nature, you will also spontaneously receive\ncreative thoughts, because the field of pure potentiality is also the field of infinite creativity and\npure knowledge. Franz Kafka, the Austrian philosopher and poet, once said, ìYou need not\nleave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait.\nYou need not even wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary. The world will freely\noffer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.î\nThe affluence of the universe ó the lavish display and abundance of the universe ó is an\nexpression of the creative mind of nature. The more tuned in you are to the mind of nature, the\nmore you have access to its infinite, unbounded creativity. But first, you have to go beyond the\nturbulence of your internal dialogue to connect with that abundant, affluent, infinite, creative\nmind. And then you create the possibility of dynamic activity while at the same time carrying the\nstillness  of  the  eternal,  unbounded,   creative  mind.  This  exquisite  combination  of  silent,  un-\nbounded, infinite mind along with dynamic, bounded, individual mind is the perfect balance of\nstillness and movement simultaneously that can create whatever you want. This coexistence of\nopposites ó stillness and dynamism at the same time ó makes you independent of situations,\ncircumstances, people, and things.\nWhen you quietly acknowledge this exquisite coexistence of opposites, you align yourself\nwith the world of energy ó the quantum soup, the non-material non-stuff that is the source of\nthe material world. This world of energy is fluid, dynamic, resilient, changing, forever in motion.\nAnd yet it is also non-changing, still, quiet, eternal, and silent.\nStillness alone is the potentiality for creativity; movement alone is creativity restricted to a\ncertain aspect of its expression. But the combination of movement and stillness enables you to\nunleash your creativity in \nall\n directions ó wherever the power of your attention takes you.\nWherever you go in the midst of movement and activity, carry your stillness within you.\nThen the chaotic movement around you will never overshadow your access to the reservoir of\ncreativity, the field of pure potentiality.\nAPPLYING  THE  LAW  OF  PURE  POTENTIALITY\nI  will  put  the  \nLaw  of  Pure  Potentiality\n  into  effect  by  making  a  commitment  to  take  the\nfollowing steps:\n(1)   I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent,\nto just \nBe.\n I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately\nthirty minutes in the morning and thirty minutes in the evening.\n(2)   I will take time each day to commune with nature and to silently witness the intelli-\ngence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to the\nsound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy of\nmy own silence, and by communing with nature, 1 will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the\nfield of pure potentiality and unbounded creativity.\n(3)   I will practice non-judgment. I will begin my day with the statement, ìToday, I shall\njudge nothing that occurs,î and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge.\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂10","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":47}}}}],["10",{"pageContent":"2\nThe  Law  of\nGiving","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":3}}}}],["11",{"pageContent":"The  universe  operates  through  dynamic  ex-\nchange... giving and receiving are different aspects\nof the flow of energy in the universe.\nAnd  in  our  willingness  to  give  that  which  we\nseek, we keep the abundance of the universe circu-\nlating in our lives.\nThis frail vessel thou emptiest again and again,\nand fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of a\nreed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast\nbreathed through it melodies eternally new. . . . Thy\ninfinite  gifts  come  to  me  only  on  those  very  small\nhands  of  mine.  Ages  pass,  and  still  thou  pourest,\nand still there is room to fill.\nó Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali\nT\nhe second spiritual law of success is the \nLaw of \nGiving. This law could also be called\nthe \nLaw of \nGiving \nand Receiving,\n because the universe operates through dynamic\nexchange. Nothing is static. Your body is in dynamic and constant exchange with\nthe body of the universe; your mind is dynamically interacting with the mind of the cosmos; your\nenergy is an expression of cosmic energy.\nThe flow of life is nothing other than the harmonious interaction of all the elements and\nforces that structure the field of existence. This harmonious interaction of elements and forces\nin your life operates as the \nLaw of Giving.\n Because your body and your mind and the universe\nare in constant and dynamic exchange, stopping the circulation of energy is like stopping the\nflow of blood. Whenever blood stops flowing, it begins to clot, to coagulate, to stagnate. That is\nwhy you must give and receive in order to keep wealth and affluence ó or anything you want in\nlife ó circulating in your life.\nThe word affluence comes from the root word ìaffluere,î which means ìto flow to.î The\nword affluence means ìto flow in abundance.î Money is really a symbol of the life energy we\nexchange  and  the  life  energy  we  use  as  a  result  of  the  service  we  provide  to  the  universe.\nAnother word for money is ìcurrency,î which also reflects the flowing nature of energy. The\nword currency comes from the Latin word ìcurrereî which means ìto runî or to flow.\nTherefore, if we stop the circulation of money ó if our only intention is to hold on to our\nmoney and hoard it ó since it is life energy, we will stop its circulation back into our lives as\nwell. In order to keep that energy coming to us, we have to keep the energy circulating. Like a\nriver, money must keep flowing, otherwise it begins to stagnate, to clog, to suffocate and stran-\ngle its very own life force. Circulation keeps it alive and vital.\nEvery relationship is one of give and take. Giving engenders receiving, and receiving en-\ngenders  giving.  What  goes  up  must  come  down;  what  goes  out  must  come  back.  In  reality,\nreceiving is the same thing as giving, because giving and receiving are different aspects of the\nflow of energy in the universe. And if you stop the flow of either, you interfere with natureís\nintelligence.\nIn every seed is the promise of thousands of forests. But the seed must not be hoarded; it\nmust give its intelligence to the fertile ground. Through its giving, its unseen energy flows into\nmaterial manifestation.\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂12","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":55}}}}],["12",{"pageContent":"The more you give, the more you will receive, because you will keep the abundance of the\nuniverse circulating in your life. In fact, anything that is of value in life only multiplies when it is\ngiven. That which doesnít multiply through giving is neither worth giving nor worth receiving. If,\nthrough the act of giving, you feel you have lost something, then the gift is not truly given and\nwill not cause increase. If you give grudgingly, there is no energy behind that giving.\nIt is the intention behind your giving and receiving that is the most important thing. The\nintention should always be to create happiness for the giver and receiver, because happiness is\nlife-supporting and life-sustaining and therefore generates increase. The return is directly pro-\nportional to the giving when it is unconditional and from the heart. That is why the act of giving\nhas to be joyful ó the frame of mind has to be one in which you feel joy in the \nvery act of\n giving.\nThen the energy behind the giving increases many times over.\nPracticing the \nLaw of Giving\n is actually very simple: if you want joy, give joy to others; if\nyou want love, learn to give love; if you want attention and appreciation, learn to give attention\nand appreciation; if you want material affluence, help others to become materially affluent. In\nfact, the easiest way to get what you want is to help others get what they want. This principle\nworks equally well for individuals, corporations, societies, and nations. If you want to be blessed\nwith all the good things in life, learn to silently bless everyone with all the good things in life.\nEven the thought of giving, the thought of blessing, or a \nsimple prayer\n has the power to\naffect others. This is because our body, reduced to its essential state, is a localized bundle of\nenergy and information in a universe of energy and information. We are localized bundles of\nconsciousness in a conscious universe. The word ìconsciousnessî implies more than just energy\nand information ó it implies energy and information which is alive as thought. Therefore we\nare bundles of thought in a thinking universe. And thought has the power to transform.\nLife is the eternal dance of consciousness that expresses itself as the dynamic exchange of\nimpulses of intelligence between microcosm and macrocosm, between the human body and the\nuniversal body, between the human mind and the cosmic mind.\nWhen you learn to give that which you seek, you activate and choreograph the dance with\nan exquisite, energetic, and vital movement that constitutes the eternal throb of life.\nThe  best  way  to  put  the  \nLaw  of  Giving\n  into  operation  ó  to  start  the  whole  process  of\ncirculation ó is to make a decision that any time you come into contact with anyone, you will\ngive them something. It doesnít have to be in the form of material things; it could be a flower, a\ncompliment, or a prayer. In fact, the most powerful forms of giving are non-material. The gifts\nof caring, attention, affection, appreciation, and love are some of the most precious gifts you\ncan give, and they donít cost you anything.\nWhen you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness,\njoy, and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful.\nOne of the things I was taught as a child, and which I taught my children also, is never to go\nto anyoneís house without bringing something ó never visit anyone without bringing them a\ngift. You may say, ìHow can I give to others when at the moment I donít have enough myself?î\nYou can bring a flower. One flower. You can bring a note or a card which says something about\nyour  feelings  for  the  person  youíre  visiting.  You  can  bring  a  compliment.  You  can  bring  a\nprayer.\nMake a decision to give wherever you go, to whomever you see. As long as youíre giving,\nyou will be receiving. The more you give, the more confidence you will gain in the miraculous\neffects of this law.

There is nothing\nunfamiliar about the \nLaw of\n Karma. Everyone has heard the expression, ìWhat you sow is what\nyou reap.î Obviously, if we want to create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow the\nseeds of happiness. Therefore, karma implies the action of conscious choice-making.\nYou and I are essentially infinite choice-makers. In every moment of our existence, we are\nin that field of all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices. Some of these\nchoices are made consciously, while others are made unconsciously. But the best way to under-\nstand and maximize the use of karmic law is to become consciously aware of the choices we\nmake in every moment.\nWhether you like it or not, everything that is happening at this moment is a result of the\nchoices youíve made in the past. Unfortunately, a lot of us make choices unconsciously, and\ntherefore we donít think they are choices ó and yet, they are.\nIf I were to insult you, you would most likely make the choice of being offended. If I were to\npay you a compliment, you would most likely make the choice of being pleased or flattered. But\nthink about it: itís still a choice.\nI  could  offend  you  and  I  could  insult  you,  and  you  could  make  the  choice  of  not  being\noffended. I could pay you a compliment and you could make the choice of not letting that flatter\nyou either.\nIn other words, most of us ó even though we are infinite choice-makers ó have become\nbundles of conditioned reflexes that are constantly being triggered by people and circumstances\ninto  predictable  outcomes  of  behaviour.  These  conditioned  reflexes  are  like  Pavlovian  condi-\ntioning. Pavlov is famous for demonstrating that if you give a dog something to eat every time\nyou  ring  a  bell,  soon  the  dog  starts  to  salivate  when  you  just  ring  the  bell,  because  it  has\nassociated one stimulus with the other.\nMost of us, as a result of conditioning, have repetitions and predictable responses to the\nstimuli  in  our  environment.  Our  reactions  seem  to  be  automatically  triggered  by  people  and\ncircumstances, and we forget that these are still choices that we are making in every moment of\nour existence. We are simply making these choices unconsciously.\nIf you step back for a moment and witness the choices you are making as you make those\nchoices, then in just this act of witnessing, you take the whole process from the unconscious\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂16","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":50}}}}],["16",{"pageContent":"realm into the conscious realm. This procedure of conscious choice-making and witnessing is\nvery empowering.\nWhen you make any choice ó any choice at all ó you can ask yourself two things: First of\nall, ìWhat are the consequences of this choice that Iím making?î In your heart you will immedi-\nately know what these are. Secondly, ìWill this choice that Iím making now bring happiness to\nme and to those around me?î If the answer is yes, then go ahead with that choice. If the answer\nis no, if that choice brings distress either to you or to those around you, then donít make that\nchoice. Itís as simple as that.\nThere is only one choice, out of the infinity of choices available in every second, that will\ncreate happiness for you as well as for those around you. And when you make that one choice,\nit will result in a form of behaviour that is called spontaneous right action. Spontaneous right\naction  is  the  right  action  at  the  right  moment.  Itís  the  right  response  to  every  situation  as  it\nhappens. Itís the action that nourishes you and everyone else who is influenced by that action.\nThere is a very interesting mechanism that the universe has to help you make spontane-\nously  correct  choices.  The  mechanism  has  to  do  with  sensations  in  your  body.  Your  body\nexperiences two kinds of sensations: one is a sensation of comfort, the other is a sensation of\ndiscomfort. At the moment you consciously make a choice, pay attention to your body and ask\nyour body, ìIf I make this choice, what happens?î If your body sends a message of comfort,\nthatís the right choice. If your body sends a message of discomfort, then itís not the appropriate\nchoice.\nFor some people the message of comfort and discomfort is in the area of the solar plexus,\nbut for most people itís in the area of the heart. Consciously put your attention in the heart and\nask your heart what to do. Then wait for the response ó a physical response in the form of a\nsensation. It may be the .faintest level of feeling ó but itís there, in your body.\nOnly the heart knows the correct answer. Most people think the heart is mushy and senti-\nmental. But itís not. The heart is intuitive; itís holistic, itís contextual, itís relational. It doesnít\nhave a win-lose orientation. It taps into the cosmic computer ó the field of pure potentiality,\npure knowledge, and infinite organizing power ó and takes everything into account. At times it\nmay not even seem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurate and\nfar more precise than anything within the limits of rational thought.\nYou can use the \nLaw of Karma\n to create money and affluence, and the flow of all good\nthings to you, any time you want. But first, you must become consciously aware that your future\nis generated by the choices you are making in every moment of your life. If you do this on a\nregular  basis,  then  you  are  making  full  use  of  the  \nLaw  of  Karma.\n  The  more  you  bring  your\nchoices into the level of your conscious awareness, the more you will make those choices which\nare spontaneously correct ó both for you and those around you.\nWhat about past karma and how it is influencing you now? There are three things you can\ndo  about  past  karma.  One  is  to  pay  your  karmic  debts.  Most  people  choose  to  do  that  ó\nunconsciously,  of  course.  This  may  be  a  choice  you  make,  also.  Sometimes  thereís  a  lot  of\nsuffering involved in the payment of those debts, but the \nLaw of Karma\n says no debt in the\nuniverse ever goes unpaid. There is a perfect accounting system in this universe, and everything\nis a constant ìto and froî exchange of energy.\nThe second thing you can do is to transmute or transform your karma to a more desirable\nexperience. This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself, as youíre paying your\nkarmic debt, ìWhat can I learn from this experience? Why is this happening and what is the\nmessage that the universe is giving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellow\nhuman beings?î\n17\nThe  law  of  Carma  or  Cause  and  Effect\n∂","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":56}}}}],["17",{"pageContent":"By doing this, you look for the seed of opportunity and then tie that seed of opportunity\nwith your \ndharma,\n with your purpose in life, which weíll talk about in the Seventh Spiritual Law\nof Success. This allows you to transmute the karma to a new expression.\nFor example, if you break your leg while playing sports, you might ask, ìWhat can I learn\nfrom this experience? What is the message that the universe is giving me?î Perhaps the mes-\nsage is that you need to slow down and be more careful or attentive to your body the next time.\nAnd if your dharma is to teach others what you know, then by asking, ìHow can I make this\nexperience useful to my fellow human beings?î you may decide to share what you learned by\nwriting a book about playing sports safely. Or you may design a special shoe or leg support that\nprevents the kind of injury you experienced.\nThis way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted the adversity into a\nbenefit that may bring you wealth and fulfillment. This is the transmutation of your karma into\na positive experience. You havenít really gotten rid of your kar\nma, \nbut you are able to take a\nkarmic episode and create a new and positive karma out of it.\nThe  third  way  to  deal  with  karma  is  to  transcend  it.  To  transcend  karma  is  to  become\nindependent of it. The way to transcend karma is to keep experiencing the gap, the Self, the\nSpirit. Itís like washing a dirty piece of cloth in a stream of water. Every time you wash it, you\ntake  away  a  few  stains.  You  keep  washing  it  again  and  again,  and  each  time  it  gets  a  little\ncleaner. You wash or transcend the seeds of your karma by going into the gap and coming out\nagain. This, of course, is done through the practice of meditation.\nAll actions are karmic episodes. Drinking a cup of coffee is a karmic episode. That action\ngenerates  memory,  and  memory  has  the  ability  or  the  potentiality  to  generate  desire.  And\ndesire generates action again. The operational software of your soul is karma, memory, and\ndesire. Your soul is a bundle of consciousness that has the seeds of karma, memory, and desire.\nBy becoming conscious of these seeds of manifestation, you become a conscious generator of\nreality. By becoming a conscious choice-maker, you begin to generate actions that are evolu-\ntionary for you and for those that are around you. And thatís all you need to do.\nAs long as karma is evolutionary ó for both the Self and everyone affected by the Self ó\nthen the fruit of karma will be happiness and success.\nAPPLYING THE LAW  OF \nKARMA  OR  CAUSE  \nAND  \nEFFECT\nI  will  put  the  \nLaw  of  Karma\n  into  effect  by  making  a  commitment  to  take  the  following\nsteps:\n(1)   Today I will witness the choices I make in each moment. And in the mere witnessing of\nthese choices, I will bring them to my conscious awareness. I will know that the best\nway to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.\n(2)   Whenever  I  make  a  choice,  I  will  ask  myself  two  questions:  ìWhat  are  the  conse-\nquences of this choice that Iím making?î and ìWill this choice bring fulfillment and\nhappiness to me and also to those who are affected by this choice?î\n(3)   I  will  then  ask  my  heart  for  guidance  and  be  guided  by  its  message  of  comfort  or\ndiscomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon. If the\nchoice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with\nmy inner vision. This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices\nfor myself and for all those around me.\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂18","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":54}}}}],["18",{"pageContent":"4\nThe law of least\neffort","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":3}}}}],["19",{"pageContent":"Nature  5  intelligence  functions  with  effortless\nease . . . with carefreeness, harmony, and love.\nAnd when we harness the forces of harmony,\njoy,  and  love,  we  create  success  and  good  fortune\nwith effortless ease.\nAn  integral  being  knows  without  going,  sees\nwithout looking, and accomplishes without doing.\nó Lao T\nZU\nT\nhe fourth spiritual law of success is the \nLaw of Least Effort.\n This law is based on the\nfact that natureís intelligence functions with effortless ease and abandoned careful\nness.  This  is  the  principle  of  least  action,  of  no  resistance.  This  is,  therefore,  the\nprinciple  of  harmony  and  love.  When  we  learn  this  lesson  from  nature,  we  easily  fulfill  our\ndesires.\nIf you observe nature at work, you will see that least effort is expended. Grass doesnít try to\ngrow,  it  just  grows.  Fish  donít  try  to  swim,  they  just  swim.  Flowers  donít  try  to  bloom,  they\nbloom. Birds donít try to fly, they fly. This is their intrinsic nture. The earth doesnít try to spin\non its own axis; it is the nature of the earth to spin with dizzying speed and to hurtle through\nspace. It is the nature of babies to be in bliss. It is the nature of the sun to shine. It is the nature\nof the stars to glitter and sparkle. And it is human nature to make our dreams manifest into\nphysical form, easily and effortlessly.\nIn Vedic Science, the age-old philosophy of India, this principle is known as the principle of\neconomy of effort, or ìdo less and accomplish more.î Ultimately you come to the state where\nyou do nothing and accomplish everything. This means that there is just a faint idea, and then\nthe manifestation of the idea comes about effortlessly. What is commonly called a ìmiracleî is\nactually an expression of the \nLaw of Least Effort.\nNatureís intelligence functions effortlessly, fric-tionlessly, spontaneously. It is non-linear; it\nis intuitive, holistic, and nourishing. And when you are in harmony with nature, when you are\nestablished in the knowledge of your true self, you can make use or the \nLaw of Least Effort.\nLeast effort is expended when your actions are motivated by love, because nature is held\ntogether by the energy of love. When you seek power and control over other people, you waste\nenergy. When you seek money or power for the sake of the ego, you spend energy chasing the\nillusion of happiness instead of enjoying happiness in the moment. When you seek money for\npersonal gain only, you cut off the flow of energy to yourself, and interfere with the expression\nof  natureís  intelligence.  But  when  your  actions  are  motivated  by  love,  there  is  no  waste  of\nenergy. When your actions are motivated by love, your energy multiplies and accumulates ó\nand the surplus energy you gather and enjoy can be channeled to create anything that you want,\nincluding unlimited wealth.\nYou can think of your physical body as a device for controlling energy: it can generate,\nstore, and expend energy. If you know how to generate, store, and expend energy in an effi-\ncient  way,  then  you  can  create  any  amount  of  wealth.  Attention  to  the  ego  consumes  the\ngreatest  amount  of  energy.  When  your  internal  reference  point  is  the  ego,  when  you  seek\npower  and  control  over  other  people  or  seek  approval  from  others,  you  spend  energy  in  a\nwasteful way.\nWhen that energy is freed up, it can be rechanneled and used to create anything that you\nwant. When your internal reference point is your spirit, when you are immune to criticism and\nunfearful of any challenge, you can harness the power of love, and use energy creatively for the\nexperience of affluence and evolution.\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂20","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":55}}}}],["20",{"pageContent":"In \nThe Art of Dreaming,\n Don Juan tells Carlos Castaneda, ì. . . most of our energy goes\ninto upholding our importance. ... If we were capable of losing some of that importance, two\nextraordinary things would happen to us: One, we would free our energy from trying to main-\ntain the illusory idea of our grandeur; and two, we would provide ourselves with enough energy\nto catch a glimpse or the actual grandeur of the universe.î\nThere are three components to the \nLaw of Least Effort ó\n three things you can do to put\nthis principle of ìdo less and accomplish moreî into action. The first component is acceptance.\nAcceptance  simply  means  that  you  make  a  commitment:  ìToday  I  will  accept  people,  situa-\ntions, circumstances, and events as they occur.î This means I will know that \nthis\n moment is \nas\nit  should  be,\n  because  the  whole  universe  is  as  it  should  be.  This  moment  ó  the  one  youíre\nexperiencing right now ó is the culmination of all the moments you have experienced in the\npast. This moment is as it is because the entire universe is as it is.\nWhen you struggle against this moment, youíre actually struggling against the entire uni-\nverse. Instead, you can make the decision that today you will not struggle against the whole\nuniverse by struggling against this moment. 1 his means that your \nacceptance\n of this moment is\ntotal and complete. You accept things as they \nare,\n not as you wish they were in this moment.\nThis is important to understand. You can \nwish\n for things in the future to be different, but in this\nmoment you have to accept things as they are.\nWhen you feel frustrated or upset by a person or a situation, remember that you are not\nreacting to the person or the situation, but to your feelings about the person or the situation.\nThese are \nyour \nfeelings, and your feelings are not someone elseís fault. When you recognize\nand understand this completely, you are ready to take responsibility for how you feel and to\nchange it. And if you can accept things as they are, you are ready to take responsibility for your\nsituation and for all the events you see as problems.\nThis leads us to the second component of the \nLaw of Least Effort:\n responsibility. What\ndoes responsibility mean? Responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for your situa-\ntion, including yourself. Having accepted this circumstance, this event, this problem, responsi-\nbility then means the \nability\n to have a creative response to the situation \nas it is now.\n All prob-\nlems contain the seeds of opportunity, and this awareness allows you to take the moment and\ntransform it to a better situation or thing.\nOnce you do this, every so-called upsetting situation will become an opportunity for the\ncreation of something new and beautiful, and every so-called tormentor or tyrant will become\nyour teacher. Reality is an interpretation. And if you choose to interpret reality in this way, you\nwill have many teachers around you, and many opportunities to evolve.\nWhenever  confronted  by  a  tyrant,  tormentor,  teacher,  friend,  or  foe  (they  all  mean  the\nsame thing) remind yourself, ìThis moment is as it should be.î Whatever relationships you have\nattracted in your life at this moment are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment.\nThere  is  a  hidden  meaning  behind  all  events,  and  this  hidden  meaning  is  serving  your  own\nevolution.\nThe third component of the \nLaw of Least Effort\n is defencelessness, which means that your\nawareness is established in defenselessness, and you have relinquished the need to convince or\npersuade others of your point of view. If you observe people around you, youíll see that they\nspend ninety-nine percent of their time defending their points of view. If you just relinquish the\nneed to defend your point of view, you will in that relinquishment, gain access to enormous\namounts of energy that have been previously wasted.\nWhen you become defensive, blame others, and do not accept and surrender to the mo-\nment, your life meets resistance. Any time you encounter resistance, recognize that if you force\nthe situation, the resistance will only increase. You donít want to stand rigid like a tall oak that\ncracks and collapses in the storm. Instead, you want to be flexible, like a reed that bends with\nthe storm and survives.\nCompletely desist from defending your point of view. When you have no point to defend,\nyou do not allow the birth of an argument.

In fact, at the\nlevel of the quantum field, there is nothing other than energy and information. The\nquantum field is just another label for the field of pure consciousness or pure potentiality. And\nthis quantum field is influenced by intention and desire. Letís examine this process in detail.\nA flower, a rainbow, a tree, a blade of grass, a human body, when broken down to their\nessential components, are energy and information. The whole universe, in its essential nature,\nis the \nmovement\n of energy and information. The only difference between you and a tree is the\ninformational and energy content of your respective bodies.\nOn the material level, both you and the tree are made up of the same recycled elements:\nmostly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements in minute amounts. You could\nbuy these elements in a hardware store for a couple of dollars. The difference, therefore, be-\ntween you and the tree is not the carbon, or the hydrogen, or the oxygen. In fact; you and the\ntree are constantly exchanging your carbon and oxygen with each other. The real difference\nbetween the two of you is in the energy and in the information.\nIn the scheme of nature, you and I are a privileged species. We have a nervous system that\nis capable of becoming \naware of\n the energy and informational content of that localized field that\ngives  rise  to  our  physical  body.  We  \nexperience\n  this  field  \nsubjectively  as  our  own  thoughts,\nfeelings, emotions, desires, memories, instincts, drives, and beliefs. This same field is experi-\nenced objectively as the physical body ó and through the physical body, we experience this\nfield as the world. But itís all the same stuff. That is why the ancient seers exclaimed, ìI am that,\nyou are that, all this is that, and thatís all there is.î\nYour body is not separate from the body of the universe, because at quantum mechanical\nlevels there are no well-defined edges.

Attention energizes, and intention transforms. Whatever you put your\nattention on will grow stronger in your life. Whatever you take your attention away from will\nwither,  disintegrate,  and  disappear.  Intention,  on  the  other  hand,  triggers  transformation  of\nenergy and information. Intention organizes its own fulfillment.\nThe quality of intention on the object of attention will orchestrate an infinity of space-time\nevents to bring about the outcome intended, provided one follows the other spiritual laws of\nsuccess. This is because intention in the fertile ground of attention has infinite organizing power.\nInfinite organizing power means the power to organize an infinity of space-time events, all at\nthe same time. We see the expression of this infinite organizing power in every blade of grass,\nin every apple blossom, in every cell of our body. We see it in everything that is alive.\nIn  the  scheme  of  nature,  everything  correlates  and  connects  with  everything  else.  The\ngroundhog comes out of the earth and you know it is going to be spring. Birds begin to migrate\nin a certain direction at a certain time of the year. Nature is a symphony. And that symphony is\nbeing silently orchestrated at the ultimate ground of creation.\nThe human body is another good example of this symphony. A single cell in the human\nbody is doing about six trillion things per second, and it has to know what every other cell is\ndoing at the same time. The human body can play music, kill germs, make a baby, recite poetry,\nand monitor the movement of stars all at the same time, because the field of infinite correlation\nis part of its information field.\nWhat is remarkable about the nervous system of the human species is that it can command\nthis infinite organizing power through conscious intent. Intent in the human species is not fixed\nor  locked  into  a  rigid  network  of  energy  and  information.  It  has  infinite  flexibility.  In  other\nwords,  as  long  as  you  do  not  violate  the  other  laws  of  nature,  through  your  intent  you  can\nliterally command the laws of nature to fulfill your dreams and desires.\nYou can put the cosmic computer with its infinite organizing power to work for you. You\ncan go to that ultimate ground of creation and introduce an intention, and just by introducing\nthe intention, you activate the field of infinite correlation.\nIntention  lays  the  groundwork  for  the  effortless,  spontaneous,  frictionless  flow  of  pure\npotentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest to the manifest. The only caution is that\nyou use your intent for the benefit of mankind. This happens spontaneously when you are in\nalignment with The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.\nIntention is the real power behind desire. Intent alone is very powerful, because intent is\ndesire without attachment to the outcome. Desire alone is weak, because desire in most people\nis  attention  with  attachment.  Intent  is  desire  with  strict  adherence  to  all  the  other  laws,  but\nparticularly the \nLaw of Detachment,\n which is the Sixth Spiritual Law of Success.\nIntention  combined  with  detachment  leads  to  life-centered,  present-moment  awareness.\nAnd when action is performed in present-moment awareness, it is most effective. Y\nour \nintent\n is\nfor the future, but your \nattention\n is in the present. As long as your attention is in the present,\nthen your intent for the future will manifest, because the future is created in the present. You\nmust accept the present as is.

These forces are neither in the past nor in the future. They\njust are.\nOur interpretation of these abstract forces gives us the experience of concrete phenomena\nand  form.  Remembered  interpretations  of  abstract  forces  create  the  experience  of  the  past,\nanticipatory interpretations of the same abstract forces create the future. They are the qualities\nof attention in consciousness. When these qualities are freed from the burden of the past, then\naction in the present becomes the fertile ground for the creation of the future.\nIntention, grounded in this detached freedom of the present, serves as the catalyst for the\nright mix of matter, energy, and space-time events to create whatever it is that you desire.\nIf  you  have  life-centered,  present-moment  awareness,  then  the  imaginary  obstacles  ó\nwhich are more than ninety percent of perceived obstacles ó disintegrate and disappear. The\nremaining five to ten percent of perceived obstacles can be transmuted into opportunities through\none-pointed intention.\nOne-pointed intention is that quality of attention that is unbending in its fixity of purpose.\nOne-pointed  intention  means  holding  your  attention  to  the  intended  outcome  with  such  un-\nbending  purpose  that  you  absolutely  refuse  to  allow  obstacles  to  consume  and  dissipate  the\nfocused quality of your attention. There is a total and complete exclusion of all obstacles from\nyour consciousness. You are able to maintain an unshakable serenity while being committed to\nyour  goal  with  intense  passion.  This  is  the  power  of  detached  awareness  and  one-pointed,\nfocused intention simultaneously.\nLearn to harness the power of intention, and you can create anything you desire. You can\nstill get results through effort and through trying, but at a cost. The cost is stress, heart attacks,\nand the compromised function of your immune system. It is much better to execute the follow-\ning five steps in the \nLaw of\n Intention \nand Desire.\n When you follow these five steps for fulfilling\nyour desires, intention generates its own power:\n(1)   Slip into the gap. This means to center yourself in that silent space between thoughts,\nto go into the silence ó that level of Being which is your essential state.\n(2)   Established in that state of Being, release your intentions and desires. When you are\nactually in the gap, thereís no thought, thereís no intention, but as you come out of the\ngap ó at that junction between the gap and a thought ó you introduce the intention.\nIf  you  have  a  series  of  goals,  you  can  write  them  down,  and  have  your   intention\nfocused  on  them  before  you  go  into  the  gap.  If  you  want  a  successful  career,  for\nexample,  you  go  into  the  gap  with  that  intention,  and  the  intention  will  already  be\nthere as a faint flicker in your awareness. Releasing your intentions and desires in the\ngap means planting them in the fertile ground of pure potentiality, and expecting them\nto bloom when the season is right. You do not want to dig up the seeds of your desires\nto see if they are growing, or get rigidly attached to the way in which they will unfold.\nYou simply want to release them.\n(3)   Remain in the state of self-referral. This means remain established in the awareness of\nyour true Self ó your spirit, your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It also\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂26","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":51}}}}],["26",{"pageContent":"means not to look at yourself through the eyes of the world, or allow yourself to be\ninfluenced  by  the  opinions  and  criticisms  of  others.

The former eats the sweet and sour\nfruits of the tree of life, while the latter looks on in\ndetachment.\nó The Mundaka Upanishad\nT\nhe sixth spiritual law of success is the \nLaw of Detachment.\n The \nLaw of Detachment\nsays that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquish\nyour attachment to it. This doesnít mean you give up the intention to create your\ndesire.  You  donít  give  up  the  intention,  and  you  donít  give  up  the  desire.  You  give  up  your\nattachment to the result.\nThis a very powerful thing to do. The moment you relinquish your attachment to the result,\ncombining one-pointed intention with detachment at the same time, you will have that which\nyou desire. Anything you want can be acquired through detachment, because detachment is\nbased on the unquestioning belief in the power of your true Self.\nAttachment, on the other hand, is based on fear and insecurity ó and the need for security\nis based on not knowing the true Self. The source of wealth, of abundance, or of anything in the\nphysical world is the Self; it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need. Everything\nelse is a symbol: cars, houses, bank notes, clothes, airplanes. Symbols are transitory; they come\nand go. Chasing symbols is like settling for the map instead of the territory. It creates anxiety; it\nends  up  making  you  feel  hollow  and  empty  inside,  because  you  exchange  your  Self  for  the\nsymbols of your Self.\nAttachment comes from poverty consciousness, because attachment is always to symbols.\nDetachment is synonymous with wealth consciousness, because with detachment there is free-\ndom  to  create.  Only  from  detached  involvement  can  one  have  joy   and  laughter.  Then  the\nsymbols of wealth are created spontaneously and effortlessly. Without detachment we are pris-\noners of helplessness, hopelessness, mundane needs, trivial concerns, quiet desperation, and\nseriousness ó the distinctive features of everyday mediocre existence and poverty conscious-\nness.\nTrue wealth consciousness is the ability to have anything you want, anytime you want, and\nwith least effort. To be grounded in this experience you have to be grounded in the wisdom of\nuncertainty. In this uncertainty you will find the freedom to create anything you want.\nPeople are constantly seeking security, and you will find that seeking security is actually a\nvery ephemeral thing. Even attachment to money is a sign of insecurity. You might say, ìWhen\nI have X million dollars, then Iíll be secure. Then Iíll be financially independent and I will retire.\nThen I will do all the things I really want to do.î But it never happens ó \nnever\n happens.\n29\nThe  law  of  pure  Detachment∂","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":52}}}}],["29",{"pageContent":"Those who seek security chase it for a lifetime without ever finding it. it remains elusive and\nephemeral,  because  security  can  never  come  from  money  alone.  Attachment  to  money  will\nalways create insecurity no matter how much money you have in the bank. In fact, some of the\npeople who have the most money are the most insecure.\nThe  search  for  security  is  an  illusion.  In  ancient  wisdom  traditions,  the  solution  to  this\nwhole dilemma lies in the wisdom of insecurity, or the wisdom of uncertainty. This means that\nthe search for security and certainty is actually an \nattachment\n to the known. And whatís the\nknown?  The  known  is  our  past.  The  known  is  nothing  other  than  the  prison  of  past  con-\nditioning. Thereís no evolution in that ó absolutely none at all. And when there is no evolution,\nthere is stagnation, entropy, disorder, and decay.\nUncertainty, on the other hand, is the fertile ground of pure creativity and freedom. Uncer-\ntainty means stepping into the unknown in every moment of our existence. The unknown is the\nfield of all possibilities, ever fresh, ever new, always open to the creation ot new manifestations.\nWithout uncertainty and the unknown, life is just the stale repetition of outworn memories. You\nbecome the victim of the past, and your tormentor today is your self left over from yesterday.\nRelinquish your attachment to the known, step into the unknown, and you will step into the\nfield of all possibilities. In your willingness to step into the unknown, you will have the wisdom\nof uncertainty factored in. This means that in every moment of your life, you will have excite-\nment, adventure, mystery. You will experience the fun of life ó the magic, the celebration, the\nexhilaration, and the exultation of your own spirit.\nEvery day you can look for the excitement of what may occur in the field of all possibilities.\nWhen you experience uncertainty, you are on the right path ó so donít give it up. You donít\nneed to have a complete and rigid idea of what youíll be doing next week or next year, because\nif you have a very clear idea of whatís going to happen and you get rigidly attached to it, then\nyou shut out a \nwhole range of possibilities.\nOne characteristic of the field of all possibilities is infinite correlation. The field can orches-\ntrate an infinity of space-time events to bring about the outcome that is intended. But when you\nare attached, your intention gets locked into a rigid mindset and you lose the fluidity, the crea-\ntivity, and the spontaneity inherent in the field. When you get attached, you freeze your desire\nfrom that infinite fluidity and flexibility into a rigid framework which interferes with the whole\nprocess of creation.\nThe \nLaw of Detachment\n does not interfere with the \nLaw of\n Intention \nand Desire ó\n with\ngoal-setting. You still have the intention of going in a certain direction, you still have a goal.\nHowever, between point A and point B there are infinite possibilities. With uncertainty factored\nin, you might change direction in any moment if you find a higher ideal, or if you find something\nmore exciting. You are also less likely to force solutions on problems, which enables you to stay\nalert to opportunities.\nThe \nLaw of Detachment\n accelerates the whole process of evolution. When you understand\nthis law, you donít feel compelled to force solutions. When you force solutions on problems,\nyou only create new problems. But when you put your attention on the uncertainty, and you\nwitness the uncertainty while you expectantly wait for the solution to emerge out of the chaos\nand the confusion, then what emerges is something very fabulous and exciting.\nThis state of alertness ó your preparedness in the present, in the field of uncertainty ó\nmeets with your goal and your intention and allows you to seize the opportunity.

If\nyouíre unable to make a living when you grow up, Iíll provide for you, so donít worry about that.\nI donít want you to focus on doing well in school. I donít want you to focus on getting the best\ngrades or going to the best colleges.

Its  intelligence  is  ultimate  and  supreme,  and  it\npermeates  every  fiber  of  existence:  from  the  smallest  to  the  largest,  from  the  atom  to  the\ncosmos. Everything that is alive is an expression of this intelligence. And this intelligence oper-\nates through The Seven Spiritual Laws.\nIf you look at any cell in the human body, you will see through its functioning the expres-\nsion of these laws. Every cell, whether itís a stomach cell, or a heart cell, or a brain cell, has its\nbirth in the \nLaw of Pure Potentiality.\n DNA is a perfect example of pure potentiality; in fact, it is\nthe \nmaterial  expression\n  of  pure  potentiality.  The  same  DNA  existing  in  every  cell  expresses\nitself in different ways in order to fulfill the unique requirements of that particular cell.\nEach cell also operates through the \nLaw of Giving. \nA cell is alive and healthy when it is in\na state of balance and equilibrium. This state of equilibrium is one of fulfillment and harmony,\nbut it is maintained by a constant give and take. Each cell gives to and supports every other cell,\nand in turn is nourished by every other cell. The cell is always in a state of dynamic flow and the\nflow is never interrupted. In fact, the flow is the very essence of the life of the cell. And only by\nmaintaining this flow of giving is the cell able to receive and thus continue its vibrant existence.\nThe \nLaw of Karma\n is exquisitely executed by every cell, because built into its intelligence is\nthe most appropriate and precisely correct response to every situation as it occurs.\nThe \nLaw of Least Effort\n is also exquisitely executed by every cell in the body: it does its job\nwith quiet efficiency in the state of restful alertness.\n35\nThe  law  of  purpose  ∂","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":53}}}}],["35",{"pageContent":"Through the \nLaw of Intention and Desire,\n every intention of every cell harnesses the infi-\nnite organizing power of natureís intelligence.

It doesnít stumble or falter because its behaviour is a function of life-centered,\npresent-moment awareness.\nEach cell also expresses the \nLaw of Dharma.\n Each cell must discover its own source, the\nhigher self; it must serve its fellow beings, and express its unique talents. Heart cells, stomach\ncells, and immune cells all have their source in the higher self, the field of pure potentiality. And\nbecause they are directly linked to this cosmic computer, they can express their unique talents\nwith effortless ease and timeless awareness. Only by expressing their unique talents can they\nmaintain both their own integrity and the integrity of the whole body.

You will also see that your life becomes more joyful and abundant in every way,\nfor these laws are also the spiritual laws of life that make living worthwhile.\nThere is a natural sequence for the application of these laws in your daily life that may help\nyou to remember them. The \nLaw of Pure Potentiality\n is experienced through silence, through\nmeditation, through non-judgment, through communion with nature, but it is activated by the\nLaw  of\n  Giving.  The  principle  here  is  to  learn  to  give  that  which  you  seek.  Thatís  how  you\nactivate the \nLaw of Pure Potentiality. \nIf you seek affluence, give affluence; if you seek money,\ngive money; if you seek love, appreciation, and affection, then learn to give love, appreciation,\nand affection.\nThrough  your  actions  in  the  \nLaw  of\n  Giving  you  activate  the  \nLaw  of  Karma.\n You create\ngood karma, and good karma makes everything in life easy. You notice that you donít have to\nexpend a lot of effort to fulfill your desires, which automatically leads to an understanding of the\nLaw  of  Least  Effort.\n  When  everything  is  easy  and  effortless,  and  your  desires  keep  getting\nfulfilled, you spontaneously begin to understand the \nLaw of Intention and Desire.\n Fulfilling your\ndesires with effortless ease makes it easy for you to practice the \nLaw of Detachment.\nFinally,  as  you  begin  to  understand  all  the  above  laws,  you  begin  to  focus  on  your  true\npurpose in life, which leads to the \nLaw of Dharma.\n Through the use of this law, by expressing\nyour unique talents and fulfilling the needs of your fellow humans, you begin to create whatever\nyou want, whenever you want it. You become carefree and joyful, and your life becomes an\nexpression of unbounded love.\nWe are travellers on a cosmic journey ó star-dust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and\nwhirlpools  of  infinity.

When this\nknowledge is incorporated in your consciousness, it will give you the ability to create unlimited\nwealth with effortless ease, and to experience success in every endeavour.\nSuccess in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progres-\nsive realization of worthy goals. Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease.\nAnd yet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to be a process\nthat requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at the expense of others. We need a\nmore  spiritual  approach  to  success  and  to  affluence,  which  is  the  abundant  flow  of  all  good\nthings to you. With the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmony\nwith nature and create with carefulness, joy, and love.\nThere  are  many  aspects  to  success;  material  wealth  is  only  one  component.  Moreover,\nsuccess is a journey, not a destination. Material abundance, in all its expressions, happens to be\none  of  those  things  that  makes  the  journey  more  enjoyable.  But  success  also  includes  good\nhealth, energy and enthusiasm for life, fulfilling relationships, creative freedom, emotional and\npsychological stability, a sense of well-being, and peace of mind.\nEven with the experience of all these things, we will remain unfulfilled unless we nurture the\nseeds of divinity inside us. In reality, we are divinity in disguise, and the gods and goddesses in\nembryo that are contained within us seek to be fully materialized. True success is therefore the\nexperience of the miraculous. It is the unfolding of the divinity within us. It is the perception of\ndivinity wherever we go, in whatever we perceive ó in the eyes of a child, in the beauty of a\nflower, in the flight of a bird. When we begin to experience our life as the miraculous expression\nof divinity ó not occasionally, but all the time ó then we will know the true meaning of success.\nBefore defining the seven spiritual laws, let us understand the concept of law. Law is the\nprocess by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest; itís the process by which the observer\nbecomes the observed; itís the process by which the seer becomes the scenery; itís the process\nthrough which the dreamer manifests the dream.\nAll of creation, everything that exists in the physical world, is the result of the unmanifest\ntransforming itself into the manifest. Everything that we behold comes from the unknown. Our\nphysical body, the physical universe ó anything and everything that we can perceive through\nour senses ó is the transformation of the unmanifest, unknown, and invisible into the manifest,\nknown, and visible.\nThe physical universe is nothing other than the Self curving back within Itself to experience\nItself as spirit, mind, and physical matter. In other words, all processes of creation are processes\nthrough which the Self or divinity expresses Itself. Consciousness in motion expresses itself as\nthe objects of the universe in the eternal dance of life.\nThe  source  of  all  creation  is  divinity  (or  the  spirit);  the  process  of  creation  is  divinity  in\nmotion  (or  the  mind);  and  the  object  of  creation  is  the  physical  universe  (which  includes  the\nphysical body).","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":52}}}}],["43",{"pageContent":"These three components of reality ó spirit, mind, and body, or observer, the process of\nobserving, and the observed ó are essentially the same thing. They all come from the same\nplace: the field of pure potentiality which is purely unmanifest.\nThe physical laws of the universe are actually this whole process of divinity in motion, or\nconsciousness in motion. When we understand these laws and apply them in our lives, anything\nwe want can be created, because the same laws that nature uses to create a forest, or a galaxy,\nor a star, or a human body can also bring about the fulfillment of our deepest desires.\nNow letís go over \nThe Seven Spiritual Laws of Success\n and see how we can apply them in\nour lives.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":11}}}}],["44",{"pageContent":"1\nThe law of pure\npotentiality","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":3}}}}],["45",{"pageContent":"The source of all creation is pure consciousness, pure potentiality seeking expression from\nthe unmanifest to the manifest.\nAnd when we realise that our true Self is one of pure potentiality, we align with the power\nthat manifests everything in the universe.\nIn  the  beginning  there  was  neither  existence\nnor non-existence,\nAll this world was unmanifest energy . . .\nThe One breathed, without breath, by Its own\npower Nothing else was there . . .\nó Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda\nT\nhe first spiritual law of success is the Law \nof Pure Potentiality.\n This law is based on\nthe fact that we are, in our essential state, pure consciousness. Pure consciousness\nis pure potentiality; it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity. Pure con-\nsciousness  is  our  spiritual  essence.  Being  infinite  and  unbounded,  it  is  also  pure  joy.  Other\nattributes of consciousness are pure knowledge, infinite silence, perfect balance, invincibility,\nsimplicity, and bliss. This is our essential nature. Our essential nature is one of pure potentiality.\nWhen you discover your essential nature and know who you really are, in \nthat knowing\nitself  is\n  the  ability  to  fulfill  any  dream  you  have,  because  you  are  the  eternal  possibility,  the\nimmeasurable potential of all that was, is, and will be. The \nLaw of Pure Potentiality\n could also be\ncalled the \nLaw of Unity,\n because underlying the infinite diversity of life is the unity of one all-\npervasive spirit. There is no separation between you and this field of energy. The field of pure\npotentiality is your own Self. And the more you experience your true nature, the closer you are\nto the field of pure potentiality.\nThe experience of the Self, or ìself-referral,î means that our internal reference point is our\nown spirit, and not the objects of our experience. The opposite of self-referral is object-referral.\nIn object-referral we are always influenced by objects outside the Self, which include situations,\ncircumstances, people, and things. In object-referral we are constantly seeking the approval of\nothers. Our thinking and our behaviour are always in anticipation of a response. It is therefore\nfear-based.\nIn object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for\nexternal power. The need for approval, the need to control things, and the need for external\npower are needs that are based on fear. This kind of power is not the power of pure potentiality,\nor the power of the Self, or \nreal\n power. When we experience the power of the Self, there is an\nabsence  of  fear,  there  is  no  compulsion  to  control,  and  no  struggle  for  approval  or  external\npower.\nIn object-referral, your internal reference point is your ego. The ego, however, is not who\nyou really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing.\nYour social mask thrives on approval. It wants to control, and it is sustained by power, because\nit lives in fear.\nYour  true  Self,  which  is  your  spirit,  your  soul,  is  ^completely  free  of  those  things.  It  is\nimmune to criticism, it is unfearful of any challenge, and it feels beneath no one. And yet, it is\nalso humble and feels superior to no one, because it recognizes that everyone else is the same\nSelf, the same spirit in different disguises.\nThe  law  of  pure  potentiality\n∂7","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":56}}}}],["46",{"pageContent":"Thatís the essential difference between object-referral and self-referral. In self-referral, you\nexperience your true being, which is unfearful of any challenge, has respect for all people, and\nfeels beneath no one. Self-power is therefore true power.\nPower based on object-referral, however, is false power. Being ego-based power, it lasts\nonly  as  long  as  the  object  of  reference  is  there.  If  you  have  a  certain  title  ó  if  youíre  the\npresident of the country or the chairman of a corporation ó or if you have a lot of money, the\npower you enjoy goes with the title, with the job, with the money. Ego-based power will only\nlast as long as those things last. As soon as the title, the job, the money go away, so does the\npower.\nSelf-power, on the other hand, is permanent, because it is based on the knowledge of the\nSelf. And there are certain characteristics of self-power.\nIt draws people to you, and it also draws things that you want to you. It magnetizes people,\nsituations, and circumstances to support your desires. This is also called support from the laws\nof nature. It is the support of divinity; it is the support that comes from being in the state of\ngrace. Your power is such that you enjoy a bond with people, and people enjoy a bond with\nyou. Your power is that of bonding ó a bonding that comes from true love.\nHow can we apply the \nLaw of Pure Potentiality, \nthe field of all possibilities, to our lives? If\nyou want to enjoy the benefits of the field of pure potentiality, if you want to make full use of the\ncreativity which is inherent in pure consciousness, then you have to have access to it. One way\nto access the field is through the daily practice of silence, meditation, and non-judgment. Spending\ntime in nature will also give you access to the qualities inherent in the field: infinite creativity,\nfreedom, and bliss.\nPracticing silence means making a commitment to take a certain amount of time to simply\nBe.  Experiencing  silence  means  periodically  withdrawing  from  the  activity  of  speech.  It  also\nmeans periodically withdrawing from such activities as watching television, listening to the ra-\ndio, or reading a book. If you never give yourself the opportunity to experience silence, this\ncreates turbulence in your internal dialogue.\nSet aside a little time every once in a while to experience silence. Or simply make a com-\nmitment to maintain silence for a certain period each day. You could do it for two hours, or if\nthat seems a lot, do it for a one-hour period. And every once in a while experience silence for\nan extended period of time, such as a full day, or two days, or even a whole week.\nWhat happens when you go into this experience of silence? Initially your internal dialogue\nbecomes even more turbulent. You feel an intense need to say things. Iíve known people who\ngo absolutely crazy the first day or two when they commit themselves to an extended period of\nsilence. A sense of urgency and anxiety suddenly comes over them. But as they stay with the\nexperience, their internal dialogue begins to quieten. And soon the silence becomes profound.\nThis is because after a while the mind gives up; it realizes there is no point in going around and\naround if you ó the Self, the spirit, the choice-maker ó are not going to speak, period. Then,\nas  the  internal  dialogue  quietens,  you  begin  to  experience  the  stillness  of  the  field  of  pure\npotentiality.\nPracticing silence periodically as it is convenient to you is one way to experience the \nLaw\nof Pure Potentiality.\n Spending time each day in meditation is another. Ideally, you should medi-\ntate at least thirty minutes in the morning, and thirty minutes in the evening. Through medita-\ntion you will learn to experience the field of pure silence and pure awareness. In that field of\npure silence is the field of infinite correlation, the field of infinite organizing power, the ultimate\nground of creation where everything is inseparably connected with everything else.\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂ 8","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":52}}}}],["47",{"pageContent":"In the fifth spiritual law, the \nLaw of Intention and Desire,\n you will see how you can intro-\nduce a faint impulse of intention in this field, and the creation of your desires will come about\nspontaneously. But first, you have to experience stillness. Stillness is the first requirement for\nmanifesting your desires, because in stillness lies your connection to the field of pure potentiality\nthat can orchestrate an infinity of details for you.\nImagine throwing a little stone into a still pond and watching it ripple. Then, after a while,\nwhen the ripples settle down, perhaps you throw another little stone. Thatís exactly what you\ndo when you go into the field of pure silence and introduce your intention. In this silence, even\nthe faintest intention will ripple across the underlying ground of universal consciousness, which\nconnects everything with everything else. But, if you do not experience stillness in conscious-\nness, if your mind is like a turbulent ocean, you could throw the Empire State Building into it,\nand you wouldnít notice a thing. In the Bible is \nthe\n expression, ìBe still, and know that I am\nGod.î This can only be accomplished through meditation.\nAnother way to access the field of pure potentiality is through the practice of non-judg-\nment. Judgment is the constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When you\nare constantly evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create a lot of turbulence in your\ninternal dialogue. This turbulence constricts the flow of energy between you and the field of\npure potentiality. You literally squeeze the ìgapî between thoughts.\nThe gap is your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It is that state of pure aware-\nness, that silent space between thoughts, that inner stillness that connects you to true power.\nAnd when you squeeze the gap, you squeeze your connection to the field of pure potentiality\nand infinite creativity.\nThere  is  a  prayer  in  A  Course  in  Miracles  that  states,  ìToday  I  shall  judge  nothing  that\noccurs.î Non-judgment creates silence in your mind. It is a good idea, therefore, to begin your\nday with that statement. And throughout the day, remind yourself of that statement each time\nyou catch yourself judging. If practicing this procedure for the whole day seems too difficult,\nthen you may simply say to yourself, ìFor the next two hours, I wonít judge anything,î or ìFor\nthe next hour, I will experience non-judgment.î Then you can extend it gradually.\nThrough silence, through meditation, and through non-judgment, you will access the first\nlaw, the \nLaw of Pure Potentiality.\n Once you start doing that, you can add a fourth component\nto this practice, and that is regularly spending time in direct communion with nature. Spending\ntime in nature enables you to sense the harmonious interaction of all the elements and forces of\nlife, and gives you a sense of unity with all of life. Whether it be a stream, a forest, a mountain,\na lake, or the seashore, that connection with natureís intelligence will also help you access the\nfield of pure potentiality.\nYou must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence\nis beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge.\nIt is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment.\nAccess to your true essence will also give you insight into the mirror of relationship, be-\ncause all relationship is a reflection of your relationship with yourself. For example, if you have\nguilt, fear, and insecurity over money, or success, or anything else, then these are reflections of\nguilt, fear, and insecurity as basic aspects of your personality. No amount of money or success\nwill solve these basic problems of existence; only intimacy with the Self will bring about true\nhealing. And when you are grounded in the knowledge of your true Self ó when you really\nunderstand your true nature ó you will never feel guilty, fearful, or insecure about money, or\naffluence,  or  fulfilling  your  desires,  because  you  will  realize  that  the  essence  of  all  material\nwealth is life energy, it is pure potentiality. And pure potentiality is your intrinsic nature.\n9\nThe  law  of  pure  potentiality\n∂","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":56}}}}],["48",{"pageContent":"As you gain more and more access to your true nature, you will also spontaneously receive\ncreative thoughts, because the field of pure potentiality is also the field of infinite creativity and\npure knowledge. Franz Kafka, the Austrian philosopher and poet, once said, ìYou need not\nleave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait.\nYou need not even wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary. The world will freely\noffer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.î\nThe affluence of the universe ó the lavish display and abundance of the universe ó is an\nexpression of the creative mind of nature. The more tuned in you are to the mind of nature, the\nmore you have access to its infinite, unbounded creativity. But first, you have to go beyond the\nturbulence of your internal dialogue to connect with that abundant, affluent, infinite, creative\nmind. And then you create the possibility of dynamic activity while at the same time carrying the\nstillness  of  the  eternal,  unbounded,   creative  mind.  This  exquisite  combination  of  silent,  un-\nbounded, infinite mind along with dynamic, bounded, individual mind is the perfect balance of\nstillness and movement simultaneously that can create whatever you want. This coexistence of\nopposites ó stillness and dynamism at the same time ó makes you independent of situations,\ncircumstances, people, and things.\nWhen you quietly acknowledge this exquisite coexistence of opposites, you align yourself\nwith the world of energy ó the quantum soup, the non-material non-stuff that is the source of\nthe material world. This world of energy is fluid, dynamic, resilient, changing, forever in motion.\nAnd yet it is also non-changing, still, quiet, eternal, and silent.\nStillness alone is the potentiality for creativity; movement alone is creativity restricted to a\ncertain aspect of its expression. But the combination of movement and stillness enables you to\nunleash your creativity in \nall\n directions ó wherever the power of your attention takes you.\nWherever you go in the midst of movement and activity, carry your stillness within you.\nThen the chaotic movement around you will never overshadow your access to the reservoir of\ncreativity, the field of pure potentiality.\nAPPLYING  THE  LAW  OF  PURE  POTENTIALITY\nI  will  put  the  \nLaw  of  Pure  Potentiality\n  into  effect  by  making  a  commitment  to  take  the\nfollowing steps:\n(1)   I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent,\nto just \nBe.\n I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately\nthirty minutes in the morning and thirty minutes in the evening.\n(2)   I will take time each day to commune with nature and to silently witness the intelli-\ngence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to the\nsound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy of\nmy own silence, and by communing with nature, 1 will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the\nfield of pure potentiality and unbounded creativity.\n(3)   I will practice non-judgment. I will begin my day with the statement, ìToday, I shall\njudge nothing that occurs,î and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge.\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂10","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":47}}}}],["49",{"pageContent":"2\nThe  Law  of\nGiving","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":3}}}}],["50",{"pageContent":"The  universe  operates  through  dynamic  ex-\nchange... giving and receiving are different aspects\nof the flow of energy in the universe.\nAnd  in  our  willingness  to  give  that  which  we\nseek, we keep the abundance of the universe circu-\nlating in our lives.\nThis frail vessel thou emptiest again and again,\nand fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of a\nreed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast\nbreathed through it melodies eternally new. . . . Thy\ninfinite  gifts  come  to  me  only  on  those  very  small\nhands  of  mine.  Ages  pass,  and  still  thou  pourest,\nand still there is room to fill.\nó Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali\nT\nhe second spiritual law of success is the \nLaw of \nGiving. This law could also be called\nthe \nLaw of \nGiving \nand Receiving,\n because the universe operates through dynamic\nexchange. Nothing is static. Your body is in dynamic and constant exchange with\nthe body of the universe; your mind is dynamically interacting with the mind of the cosmos; your\nenergy is an expression of cosmic energy.\nThe flow of life is nothing other than the harmonious interaction of all the elements and\nforces that structure the field of existence. This harmonious interaction of elements and forces\nin your life operates as the \nLaw of Giving.\n Because your body and your mind and the universe\nare in constant and dynamic exchange, stopping the circulation of energy is like stopping the\nflow of blood. Whenever blood stops flowing, it begins to clot, to coagulate, to stagnate. That is\nwhy you must give and receive in order to keep wealth and affluence ó or anything you want in\nlife ó circulating in your life.\nThe word affluence comes from the root word ìaffluere,î which means ìto flow to.î The\nword affluence means ìto flow in abundance.î Money is really a symbol of the life energy we\nexchange  and  the  life  energy  we  use  as  a  result  of  the  service  we  provide  to  the  universe.\nAnother word for money is ìcurrency,î which also reflects the flowing nature of energy. The\nword currency comes from the Latin word ìcurrereî which means ìto runî or to flow.\nTherefore, if we stop the circulation of money ó if our only intention is to hold on to our\nmoney and hoard it ó since it is life energy, we will stop its circulation back into our lives as\nwell. In order to keep that energy coming to us, we have to keep the energy circulating. Like a\nriver, money must keep flowing, otherwise it begins to stagnate, to clog, to suffocate and stran-\ngle its very own life force. Circulation keeps it alive and vital.\nEvery relationship is one of give and take. Giving engenders receiving, and receiving en-\ngenders  giving.  What  goes  up  must  come  down;  what  goes  out  must  come  back.  In  reality,\nreceiving is the same thing as giving, because giving and receiving are different aspects of the\nflow of energy in the universe. And if you stop the flow of either, you interfere with natureís\nintelligence.\nIn every seed is the promise of thousands of forests. But the seed must not be hoarded; it\nmust give its intelligence to the fertile ground. Through its giving, its unseen energy flows into\nmaterial manifestation.\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂12","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":55}}}}],["51",{"pageContent":"The more you give, the more you will receive, because you will keep the abundance of the\nuniverse circulating in your life. In fact, anything that is of value in life only multiplies when it is\ngiven. That which doesnít multiply through giving is neither worth giving nor worth receiving. If,\nthrough the act of giving, you feel you have lost something, then the gift is not truly given and\nwill not cause increase. If you give grudgingly, there is no energy behind that giving.\nIt is the intention behind your giving and receiving that is the most important thing. The\nintention should always be to create happiness for the giver and receiver, because happiness is\nlife-supporting and life-sustaining and therefore generates increase. The return is directly pro-\nportional to the giving when it is unconditional and from the heart. That is why the act of giving\nhas to be joyful ó the frame of mind has to be one in which you feel joy in the \nvery act of\n giving.\nThen the energy behind the giving increases many times over.\nPracticing the \nLaw of Giving\n is actually very simple: if you want joy, give joy to others; if\nyou want love, learn to give love; if you want attention and appreciation, learn to give attention\nand appreciation; if you want material affluence, help others to become materially affluent. In\nfact, the easiest way to get what you want is to help others get what they want. This principle\nworks equally well for individuals, corporations, societies, and nations. If you want to be blessed\nwith all the good things in life, learn to silently bless everyone with all the good things in life.\nEven the thought of giving, the thought of blessing, or a \nsimple prayer\n has the power to\naffect others. This is because our body, reduced to its essential state, is a localized bundle of\nenergy and information in a universe of energy and information. We are localized bundles of\nconsciousness in a conscious universe. The word ìconsciousnessî implies more than just energy\nand information ó it implies energy and information which is alive as thought. Therefore we\nare bundles of thought in a thinking universe. And thought has the power to transform.\nLife is the eternal dance of consciousness that expresses itself as the dynamic exchange of\nimpulses of intelligence between microcosm and macrocosm, between the human body and the\nuniversal body, between the human mind and the cosmic mind.\nWhen you learn to give that which you seek, you activate and choreograph the dance with\nan exquisite, energetic, and vital movement that constitutes the eternal throb of life.\nThe  best  way  to  put  the  \nLaw  of  Giving\n  into  operation  ó  to  start  the  whole  process  of\ncirculation ó is to make a decision that any time you come into contact with anyone, you will\ngive them something.

The gifts\nof caring, attention, affection, appreciation, and love are some of the most precious gifts you\ncan give, and they donít cost you anything.\nWhen you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness,\njoy, and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful.\nOne of the things I was taught as a child, and which I taught my children also, is never to go\nto anyoneís house without bringing something ó never visit anyone without bringing them a\ngift. You may say, ìHow can I give to others when at the moment I donít have enough myself?î\nYou can bring a flower. One flower. You can bring a note or a card which says something about\nyour  feelings  for  the  person  youíre  visiting.  You  can  bring  a  compliment.  You  can  bring  a\nprayer.\nMake a decision to give wherever you go, to whomever you see. As long as youíre giving,\nyou will be receiving. The more you give, the more confidence you will gain in the miraculous\neffects of this law.

There is nothing\nunfamiliar about the \nLaw of\n Karma. Everyone has heard the expression, ìWhat you sow is what\nyou reap.î Obviously, if we want to create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow the\nseeds of happiness. Therefore, karma implies the action of conscious choice-making.\nYou and I are essentially infinite choice-makers. In every moment of our existence, we are\nin that field of all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices. Some of these\nchoices are made consciously, while others are made unconsciously. But the best way to under-\nstand and maximize the use of karmic law is to become consciously aware of the choices we\nmake in every moment.\nWhether you like it or not, everything that is happening at this moment is a result of the\nchoices youíve made in the past. Unfortunately, a lot of us make choices unconsciously, and\ntherefore we donít think they are choices ó and yet, they are.\nIf I were to insult you, you would most likely make the choice of being offended. If I were to\npay you a compliment, you would most likely make the choice of being pleased or flattered. But\nthink about it: itís still a choice.\nI  could  offend  you  and  I  could  insult  you,  and  you  could  make  the  choice  of  not  being\noffended. I could pay you a compliment and you could make the choice of not letting that flatter\nyou either.\nIn other words, most of us ó even though we are infinite choice-makers ó have become\nbundles of conditioned reflexes that are constantly being triggered by people and circumstances\ninto  predictable  outcomes  of  behaviour.  These  conditioned  reflexes  are  like  Pavlovian  condi-\ntioning. Pavlov is famous for demonstrating that if you give a dog something to eat every time\nyou  ring  a  bell,  soon  the  dog  starts  to  salivate  when  you  just  ring  the  bell,  because  it  has\nassociated one stimulus with the other.\nMost of us, as a result of conditioning, have repetitions and predictable responses to the\nstimuli  in  our  environment.  Our  reactions  seem  to  be  automatically  triggered  by  people  and\ncircumstances, and we forget that these are still choices that we are making in every moment of\nour existence. We are simply making these choices unconsciously.\nIf you step back for a moment and witness the choices you are making as you make those\nchoices, then in just this act of witnessing, you take the whole process from the unconscious\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂16","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":50}}}}],["55",{"pageContent":"realm into the conscious realm. This procedure of conscious choice-making and witnessing is\nvery empowering.\nWhen you make any choice ó any choice at all ó you can ask yourself two things: First of\nall, ìWhat are the consequences of this choice that Iím making?î In your heart you will immedi-\nately know what these are. Secondly, ìWill this choice that Iím making now bring happiness to\nme and to those around me?î If the answer is yes, then go ahead with that choice. If the answer\nis no, if that choice brings distress either to you or to those around you, then donít make that\nchoice. Itís as simple as that.\nThere is only one choice, out of the infinity of choices available in every second, that will\ncreate happiness for you as well as for those around you. And when you make that one choice,\nit will result in a form of behaviour that is called spontaneous right action. Spontaneous right\naction  is  the  right  action  at  the  right  moment.  Itís  the  right  response  to  every  situation  as  it\nhappens. Itís the action that nourishes you and everyone else who is influenced by that action.\nThere is a very interesting mechanism that the universe has to help you make spontane-\nously  correct  choices.  The  mechanism  has  to  do  with  sensations  in  your  body.  Your  body\nexperiences two kinds of sensations: one is a sensation of comfort, the other is a sensation of\ndiscomfort. At the moment you consciously make a choice, pay attention to your body and ask\nyour body, ìIf I make this choice, what happens?î If your body sends a message of comfort,\nthatís the right choice. If your body sends a message of discomfort, then itís not the appropriate\nchoice.\nFor some people the message of comfort and discomfort is in the area of the solar plexus,\nbut for most people itís in the area of the heart. Consciously put your attention in the heart and\nask your heart what to do. Then wait for the response ó a physical response in the form of a\nsensation. It may be the .faintest level of feeling ó but itís there, in your body.\nOnly the heart knows the correct answer. Most people think the heart is mushy and senti-\nmental. But itís not. The heart is intuitive; itís holistic, itís contextual, itís relational. It doesnít\nhave a win-lose orientation. It taps into the cosmic computer ó the field of pure potentiality,\npure knowledge, and infinite organizing power ó and takes everything into account. At times it\nmay not even seem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurate and\nfar more precise than anything within the limits of rational thought.\nYou can use the \nLaw of Karma\n to create money and affluence, and the flow of all good\nthings to you, any time you want. But first, you must become consciously aware that your future\nis generated by the choices you are making in every moment of your life. If you do this on a\nregular  basis,  then  you  are  making  full  use  of  the  \nLaw  of  Karma.\n  The  more  you  bring  your\nchoices into the level of your conscious awareness, the more you will make those choices which\nare spontaneously correct ó both for you and those around you.\nWhat about past karma and how it is influencing you now? There are three things you can\ndo  about  past  karma.  One  is  to  pay  your  karmic  debts.  Most  people  choose  to  do  that  ó\nunconsciously,  of  course.  This  may  be  a  choice  you  make,  also.  Sometimes  thereís  a  lot  of\nsuffering involved in the payment of those debts, but the \nLaw of Karma\n says no debt in the\nuniverse ever goes unpaid. There is a perfect accounting system in this universe, and everything\nis a constant ìto and froî exchange of energy.\nThe second thing you can do is to transmute or transform your karma to a more desirable\nexperience. This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself, as youíre paying your\nkarmic debt, ìWhat can I learn from this experience? Why is this happening and what is the\nmessage that the universe is giving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellow\nhuman beings?î\n17\nThe  law  of  Carma  or  Cause  and  Effect\n∂","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":56}}}}],["56",{"pageContent":"By doing this, you look for the seed of opportunity and then tie that seed of opportunity\nwith your \ndharma,\n with your purpose in life, which weíll talk about in the Seventh Spiritual Law\nof Success. This allows you to transmute the karma to a new expression.\nFor example, if you break your leg while playing sports, you might ask, ìWhat can I learn\nfrom this experience? What is the message that the universe is giving me?î Perhaps the mes-\nsage is that you need to slow down and be more careful or attentive to your body the next time.\nAnd if your dharma is to teach others what you know, then by asking, ìHow can I make this\nexperience useful to my fellow human beings?î you may decide to share what you learned by\nwriting a book about playing sports safely. Or you may design a special shoe or leg support that\nprevents the kind of injury you experienced.\nThis way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted the adversity into a\nbenefit that may bring you wealth and fulfillment. This is the transmutation of your karma into\na positive experience. You havenít really gotten rid of your kar\nma, \nbut you are able to take a\nkarmic episode and create a new and positive karma out of it.\nThe  third  way  to  deal  with  karma  is  to  transcend  it.  To  transcend  karma  is  to  become\nindependent of it. The way to transcend karma is to keep experiencing the gap, the Self, the\nSpirit. Itís like washing a dirty piece of cloth in a stream of water. Every time you wash it, you\ntake  away  a  few  stains.  You  keep  washing  it  again  and  again,  and  each  time  it  gets  a  little\ncleaner. You wash or transcend the seeds of your karma by going into the gap and coming out\nagain. This, of course, is done through the practice of meditation.\nAll actions are karmic episodes. Drinking a cup of coffee is a karmic episode. That action\ngenerates  memory,  and  memory  has  the  ability  or  the  potentiality  to  generate  desire.  And\ndesire generates action again. The operational software of your soul is karma, memory, and\ndesire. Your soul is a bundle of consciousness that has the seeds of karma, memory, and desire.\nBy becoming conscious of these seeds of manifestation, you become a conscious generator of\nreality. By becoming a conscious choice-maker, you begin to generate actions that are evolu-\ntionary for you and for those that are around you. And thatís all you need to do.\nAs long as karma is evolutionary ó for both the Self and everyone affected by the Self ó\nthen the fruit of karma will be happiness and success.\nAPPLYING THE LAW  OF \nKARMA  OR  CAUSE  \nAND  \nEFFECT\nI  will  put  the  \nLaw  of  Karma\n  into  effect  by  making  a  commitment  to  take  the  following\nsteps:\n(1)   Today I will witness the choices I make in each moment. And in the mere witnessing of\nthese choices, I will bring them to my conscious awareness. I will know that the best\nway to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.\n(2)   Whenever  I  make  a  choice,  I  will  ask  myself  two  questions:  ìWhat  are  the  conse-\nquences of this choice that Iím making?î and ìWill this choice bring fulfillment and\nhappiness to me and also to those who are affected by this choice?î\n(3)   I  will  then  ask  my  heart  for  guidance  and  be  guided  by  its  message  of  comfort  or\ndiscomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon. If the\nchoice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with\nmy inner vision. This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices\nfor myself and for all those around me.\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂18","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":54}}}}],["57",{"pageContent":"4\nThe law of least\neffort","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":3}}}}],["58",{"pageContent":"Nature  5  intelligence  functions  with  effortless\nease . . . with carefreeness, harmony, and love.\nAnd when we harness the forces of harmony,\njoy,  and  love,  we  create  success  and  good  fortune\nwith effortless ease.\nAn  integral  being  knows  without  going,  sees\nwithout looking, and accomplishes without doing.\nó Lao T\nZU\nT\nhe fourth spiritual law of success is the \nLaw of Least Effort.\n This law is based on the\nfact that natureís intelligence functions with effortless ease and abandoned careful\nness.  This  is  the  principle  of  least  action,  of  no  resistance.  This  is,  therefore,  the\nprinciple  of  harmony  and  love.  When  we  learn  this  lesson  from  nature,  we  easily  fulfill  our\ndesires.\nIf you observe nature at work, you will see that least effort is expended. Grass doesnít try to\ngrow,  it  just  grows.  Fish  donít  try  to  swim,  they  just  swim.  Flowers  donít  try  to  bloom,  they\nbloom. Birds donít try to fly, they fly.

It is the nature of babies to be in bliss. It is the nature of the sun to shine. It is the nature\nof the stars to glitter and sparkle. And it is human nature to make our dreams manifest into\nphysical form, easily and effortlessly.\nIn Vedic Science, the age-old philosophy of India, this principle is known as the principle of\neconomy of effort, or ìdo less and accomplish more.î Ultimately you come to the state where\nyou do nothing and accomplish everything. This means that there is just a faint idea, and then\nthe manifestation of the idea comes about effortlessly. What is commonly called a ìmiracleî is\nactually an expression of the \nLaw of Least Effort.\nNatureís intelligence functions effortlessly, fric-tionlessly, spontaneously. It is non-linear; it\nis intuitive, holistic, and nourishing. And when you are in harmony with nature, when you are\nestablished in the knowledge of your true self, you can make use or the \nLaw of Least Effort.\nLeast effort is expended when your actions are motivated by love, because nature is held\ntogether by the energy of love. When you seek power and control over other people, you waste\nenergy. When you seek money or power for the sake of the ego, you spend energy chasing the\nillusion of happiness instead of enjoying happiness in the moment. When you seek money for\npersonal gain only, you cut off the flow of energy to yourself, and interfere with the expression\nof  natureís  intelligence.  But  when  your  actions  are  motivated  by  love,  there  is  no  waste  of\nenergy. When your actions are motivated by love, your energy multiplies and accumulates ó\nand the surplus energy you gather and enjoy can be channeled to create anything that you want,\nincluding unlimited wealth.\nYou can think of your physical body as a device for controlling energy: it can generate,\nstore, and expend energy. If you know how to generate, store, and expend energy in an effi-\ncient  way,  then  you  can  create  any  amount  of  wealth.  Attention  to  the  ego  consumes  the\ngreatest  amount  of  energy.  When  your  internal  reference  point  is  the  ego,  when  you  seek\npower  and  control  over  other  people  or  seek  approval  from  others,  you  spend  energy  in  a\nwasteful way.\nWhen that energy is freed up, it can be rechanneled and used to create anything that you\nwant. When your internal reference point is your spirit, when you are immune to criticism and\nunfearful of any challenge, you can harness the power of love, and use energy creatively for the\nexperience of affluence and evolution.\nThe  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success\n∂20","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":55}}}}],["59",{"pageContent":"In \nThe Art of Dreaming,\n Don Juan tells Carlos Castaneda, ì. . . most of our energy goes\ninto upholding our importance. ... If we were capable of losing some of that importance, two\nextraordinary things would happen to us: One, we would free our energy from trying to main-\ntain the illusory idea of our grandeur; and two, we would provide ourselves with enough energy\nto catch a glimpse or the actual grandeur of the universe.î\nThere are three components to the \nLaw of Least Effort ó\n three things you can do to put\nthis principle of ìdo less and accomplish moreî into action. The first component is acceptance.\nAcceptance  simply  means  that  you  make  a  commitment:  ìToday  I  will  accept  people,  situa-\ntions, circumstances, and events as they occur.î This means I will know that \nthis\n moment is \nas\nit  should  be,\n  because  the  whole  universe  is  as  it  should  be.  This  moment  ó  the  one  youíre\nexperiencing right now ó is the culmination of all the moments you have experienced in the\npast. This moment is as it is because the entire universe is as it is.\nWhen you struggle against this moment, youíre actually struggling against the entire uni-\nverse. Instead, you can make the decision that today you will not struggle against the whole\nuniverse by struggling against this moment. 1 his means that your \nacceptance\n of this moment is\ntotal and complete. You accept things as they \nare,\n not as you wish they were in this moment.\nThis is important to understand. You can \nwish\n for things in the future to be different, but in this\nmoment you have to accept things as they are.\nWhen you feel frustrated or upset by a person or a situation, remember that you are not\nreacting to the person or the situation, but to your feelings about the person or the situation.\nThese are \nyour \nfeelings, and your feelings are not someone elseís fault. When you recognize\nand understand this completely, you are ready to take responsibility for how you feel and to\nchange it. And if you can accept things as they are, you are ready to take responsibility for your\nsituation and for all the events you see as problems.\nThis leads us to the second component of the \nLaw of Least Effort:\n responsibility. What\ndoes responsibility mean? Responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for your situa-\ntion, including yourself. Having accepted this circumstance, this event, this problem, responsi-\nbility then means the \nability\n to have a creative response to the situation \nas it is now.\n All prob-\nlems contain the seeds of opportunity, and this awareness allows you to take the moment and\ntransform it to a better situation or thing.\nOnce you do this, every so-called upsetting situation will become an opportunity for the\ncreation of something new and beautiful, and every so-called tormentor or tyrant will become\nyour teacher. Reality is an interpretation. And if you choose to interpret reality in this way, you\nwill have many teachers around you, and many opportunities to evolve.\nWhenever  confronted  by  a  tyrant,  tormentor,  teacher,  friend,  or  foe  (they  all  mean  the\nsame thing) remind yourself, ìThis moment is as it should be.î Whatever relationships you have\nattracted in your life at this moment are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment.\nThere  is  a  hidden  meaning  behind  all  events,  and  this  hidden  meaning  is  serving  your  own\nevolution.\nThe third component of the \nLaw of Least Effort\n is defencelessness, which means that your\nawareness is established in defenselessness, and you have relinquished the need to convince or\npersuade others of your point of view. If you observe people around you, youíll see that they\nspend ninety-nine percent of their time defending their points of view. If you just relinquish the\nneed to defend your point of view, you will in that relinquishment, gain access to enormous\namounts of energy that have been previously wasted.\nWhen you become defensive, blame others, and do not accept and surrender to the mo-\nment, your life meets resistance. Any time you encounter resistance, recognize that if you force\nthe situation, the resistance will only increase. You donít want to stand rigid like a tall oak that\ncracks and collapses in the storm. Instead, you want to be flexible, like a reed that bends with\nthe storm and survives.\nCompletely desist from defending your point of view.

Intention organizes its own fulfillment.\nThe quality of intention on the object of attention will orchestrate an infinity of space-time\nevents to bring about the outcome intended, provided one follows the other spiritual laws of\nsuccess. This is because intention in the fertile ground of attention has infinite organizing power.\nInfinite organizing power means the power to organize an infinity of space-time events, all at\nthe same time. We see the expression of this infinite organizing power in every blade of grass,\nin every apple blossom, in every cell of our body. We see it in everything that is alive.\nIn  the  scheme  of  nature,  everything  correlates  and  connects  with  everything  else.  The\ngroundhog comes out of the earth and you know it is going to be spring. Birds begin to migrate\nin a certain direction at a certain time of the year. Nature is a symphony. And that symphony is\nbeing silently orchestrated at the ultimate ground of creation.\nThe human body is another good example of this symphony. A single cell in the human\nbody is doing about six trillion things per second, and it has to know what every other cell is\ndoing at the same time. The human body can play music, kill germs, make a baby, recite poetry,\nand monitor the movement of stars all at the same time, because the field of infinite correlation\nis part of its information field.\nWhat is remarkable about the nervous system of the human species is that it can command\nthis infinite organizing power through conscious intent. Intent in the human species is not fixed\nor  locked  into  a  rigid  network  of  energy  and  information.  It  has  infinite  flexibility.  In  other\nwords,  as  long  as  you  do  not  violate  the  other  laws  of  nature,  through  your  intent  you  can\nliterally command the laws of nature to fulfill your dreams and desires.\nYou can put the cosmic computer with its infinite organizing power to work for you. You\ncan go to that ultimate ground of creation and introduce an intention, and just by introducing\nthe intention, you activate the field of infinite correlation.\nIntention  lays  the  groundwork  for  the  effortless,  spontaneous,  frictionless  flow  of  pure\npotentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest to the manifest. The only caution is that\nyou use your intent for the benefit of mankind. This happens spontaneously when you are in\nalignment with The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.\nIntention is the real power behind desire. Intent alone is very powerful, because intent is\ndesire without attachment to the outcome. Desire alone is weak, because desire in most people\nis  attention  with  attachment.  Intent  is  desire  with  strict  adherence  to  all  the  other  laws,  but\nparticularly the \nLaw of Detachment,\n which is the Sixth Spiritual Law of Success.\nIntention  combined  with  detachment  leads  to  life-centered,  present-moment  awareness.\nAnd when action is performed in present-moment awareness, it is most effective. Y\nour \nintent\n is\nfor the future, but your \nattention\n is in the present. As long as your attention is in the present,\nthen your intent for the future will manifest, because the future is created in the present. You\nmust accept the present as is. Accept the present and intend the future. The future is something\nyou can always create through detached intention, but you should never struggle against the\npresent.\n25\nThe  law  of  Intention  and  Desire∂","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":54}}}}],["64",{"pageContent":"The past, present, and future are all properties of consciousness. The past is recollection,\nmemory; the future is anticipation; the present is awareness. Therefore time is the movement\nof thought. Both past and future are born in the imagination; only the present, which is aware-\nness, is real and eternal. It is. It is the potentiality for space-time, matter, and energy. It is an\neternal field of possibilities experiencing itself as abstract forces, whether they be light, heat,\nelectricity, magnetism, or gravity. These forces are neither in the past nor in the future. They\njust are.\nOur interpretation of these abstract forces gives us the experience of concrete phenomena\nand  form.  Remembered  interpretations  of  abstract  forces  create  the  experience  of  the  past,\nanticipatory interpretations of the same abstract forces create the future. They are the qualities\nof attention in consciousness. When these qualities are freed from the burden of the past, then\naction in the present becomes the fertile ground for the creation of the future.\nIntention, grounded in this detached freedom of the present, serves as the catalyst for the\nright mix of matter, energy, and space-time events to create whatever it is that you desire.\nIf  you  have  life-centered,  present-moment  awareness,  then  the  imaginary  obstacles  ó\nwhich are more than ninety percent of perceived obstacles ó disintegrate and disappear. The\nremaining five to ten percent of perceived obstacles can be transmuted into opportunities through\none-pointed intention.\nOne-pointed intention is that quality of attention that is unbending in its fixity of purpose.\nOne-pointed  intention  means  holding  your  attention  to  the  intended  outcome  with  such  un-\nbending  purpose  that  you  absolutely  refuse  to  allow  obstacles  to  consume  and  dissipate  the\nfocused quality of your attention. There is a total and complete exclusion of all obstacles from\nyour consciousness. You are able to maintain an unshakable serenity while being committed to\nyour  goal  with  intense  passion.  This  is  the  power  of  detached  awareness  and  one-pointed,\nfocused intention simultaneously.\nLearn to harness the power of intention, and you can create anything you desire. You can\nstill get results through effort and through trying, but at a cost. The cost is stress, heart attacks,\nand the compromised function of your immune system. It is much better to execute the follow-\ning five steps in the \nLaw of\n Intention \nand Desire.\n When you follow these five steps for fulfilling\nyour desires, intention generates its own power:\n(1)   Slip into the gap. This means to center yourself in that silent space between thoughts,\nto go into the silence ó that level of Being which is your essential state.\n(2)   Established in that state of Being, release your intentions and desires. When you are\nactually in the gap, thereís no thought, thereís no intention, but as you come out of the\ngap ó at that junction between the gap and a thought ó you introduce the intention.\nIf  you  have  a  series  of  goals,  you  can  write  them  down,  and  have  your   intention\nfocused  on  them  before  you  go  into  the  gap.  If  you  want  a  successful  career,  for\nexample,  you  go  into  the  gap  with  that  intention,  and  the  intention  will  already  be\nthere as a faint flicker in your awareness. Releasing your intentions and desires in the\ngap means planting them in the fertile ground of pure potentiality, and expecting them\nto bloom when the season is right. You do not want to dig up the seeds of your desires\nto see if they are growing, or get rigidly attached to the way in which they will unfold.\nYou simply want to release them.\n(3)   Remain in the state of self-referral. This means remain established in the awareness of\nyour true Self ó your spirit, your connection to the field of pure potentiality.

This means giving up your rigid attach-\nment to a specific result and living in the wisdom of uncertainty. It means enjoying\nevery moment in the journey of your life, even if you donít know the outcome.\n(5)   Let the universe handle the details. Your intentions and desires, when released in the\ngap, have infinite organizing power. Trust that infinite organizing power of intention\nto orchestrate all the details for you.\nRemember that your true nature is one of pure spirit.

I  will\nrefuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of my attention in the\npresent moment.

The former eats the sweet and sour\nfruits of the tree of life, while the latter looks on in\ndetachment.\nó The Mundaka Upanishad\nT\nhe sixth spiritual law of success is the \nLaw of Detachment.\n The \nLaw of Detachment\nsays that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquish\nyour attachment to it. This doesnít mean you give up the intention to create your\ndesire.  You  donít  give  up  the  intention,  and  you  donít  give  up  the  desire.  You  give  up  your\nattachment to the result.\nThis a very powerful thing to do. The moment you relinquish your attachment to the result,\ncombining one-pointed intention with detachment at the same time, you will have that which\nyou desire. Anything you want can be acquired through detachment, because detachment is\nbased on the unquestioning belief in the power of your true Self.\nAttachment, on the other hand, is based on fear and insecurity ó and the need for security\nis based on not knowing the true Self. The source of wealth, of abundance, or of anything in the\nphysical world is the Self; it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need. Everything\nelse is a symbol: cars, houses, bank notes, clothes, airplanes. Symbols are transitory; they come\nand go. Chasing symbols is like settling for the map instead of the territory. It creates anxiety; it\nends  up  making  you  feel  hollow  and  empty  inside,  because  you  exchange  your  Self  for  the\nsymbols of your Self.\nAttachment comes from poverty consciousness, because attachment is always to symbols.\nDetachment is synonymous with wealth consciousness, because with detachment there is free-\ndom  to  create.  Only  from  detached  involvement  can  one  have  joy   and  laughter.  Then  the\nsymbols of wealth are created spontaneously and effortlessly. Without detachment we are pris-\noners of helplessness, hopelessness, mundane needs, trivial concerns, quiet desperation, and\nseriousness ó the distinctive features of everyday mediocre existence and poverty conscious-\nness.\nTrue wealth consciousness is the ability to have anything you want, anytime you want, and\nwith least effort. To be grounded in this experience you have to be grounded in the wisdom of\nuncertainty. In this uncertainty you will find the freedom to create anything you want.\nPeople are constantly seeking security, and you will find that seeking security is actually a\nvery ephemeral thing. Even attachment to money is a sign of insecurity. You might say, ìWhen\nI have X million dollars, then Iíll be secure. Then Iíll be financially independent and I will retire.\nThen I will do all the things I really want to do.î But it never happens ó \nnever\n happens.\n29\nThe  law  of  pure  Detachment∂","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":52}}}}],["68",{"pageContent":"Those who seek security chase it for a lifetime without ever finding it. it remains elusive and\nephemeral,  because  security  can  never  come  from  money  alone.  Attachment  to  money  will\nalways create insecurity no matter how much money you have in the bank. In fact, some of the\npeople who have the most money are the most insecure.\nThe  search  for  security  is  an  illusion.  In  ancient  wisdom  traditions,  the  solution  to  this\nwhole dilemma lies in the wisdom of insecurity, or the wisdom of uncertainty. This means that\nthe search for security and certainty is actually an \nattachment\n to the known. And whatís the\nknown?  The  known  is  our  past.  The  known  is  nothing  other  than  the  prison  of  past  con-\nditioning. Thereís no evolution in that ó absolutely none at all. And when there is no evolution,\nthere is stagnation, entropy, disorder, and decay.\nUncertainty, on the other hand, is the fertile ground of pure creativity and freedom. Uncer-\ntainty means stepping into the unknown in every moment of our existence. The unknown is the\nfield of all possibilities, ever fresh, ever new, always open to the creation ot new manifestations.\nWithout uncertainty and the unknown, life is just the stale repetition of outworn memories. You\nbecome the victim of the past, and your tormentor today is your self left over from yesterday.\nRelinquish your attachment to the known, step into the unknown, and you will step into the\nfield of all possibilities. In your willingness to step into the unknown, you will have the wisdom\nof uncertainty factored in. This means that in every moment of your life, you will have excite-\nment, adventure, mystery. You will experience the fun of life ó the magic, the celebration, the\nexhilaration, and the exultation of your own spirit.\nEvery day you can look for the excitement of what may occur in the field of all possibilities.\nWhen you experience uncertainty, you are on the right path ó so donít give it up. You donít\nneed to have a complete and rigid idea of what youíll be doing next week or next year, because\nif you have a very clear idea of whatís going to happen and you get rigidly attached to it, then\nyou shut out a \nwhole range of possibilities.\nOne characteristic of the field of all possibilities is infinite correlation. The field can orches-\ntrate an infinity of space-time events to bring about the outcome that is intended. But when you\nare attached, your intention gets locked into a rigid mindset and you lose the fluidity, the crea-\ntivity, and the spontaneity inherent in the field. When you get attached, you freeze your desire\nfrom that infinite fluidity and flexibility into a rigid framework which interferes with the whole\nprocess of creation.\nThe \nLaw of Detachment\n does not interfere with the \nLaw of\n Intention \nand Desire ó\n with\ngoal-setting. You still have the intention of going in a certain direction, you still have a goal.\nHowever, between point A and point B there are infinite possibilities. With uncertainty factored\nin, you might change direction in any moment if you find a higher ideal, or if you find something\nmore exciting. You are also less likely to force solutions on problems, which enables you to stay\nalert to opportunities.\nThe \nLaw of Detachment\n accelerates the whole process of evolution. When you understand\nthis law, you donít feel compelled to force solutions. When you force solutions on problems,\nyou only create new problems. But when you put your attention on the uncertainty, and you\nwitness the uncertainty while you expectantly wait for the solution to emerge out of the chaos\nand the confusion, then what emerges is something very fabulous and exciting.\nThis state of alertness ó your preparedness in the present, in the field of uncertainty ó\nmeets with your goal and your intention and allows you to seize the opportunity.

If\nyouíre unable to make a living when you grow up, Iíll provide for you, so donít worry about that.\nI donít want you to focus on doing well in school. I donít want you to focus on getting the best\ngrades or going to the best colleges.

Its  intelligence  is  ultimate  and  supreme,  and  it\npermeates  every  fiber  of  existence:  from  the  smallest  to  the  largest,  from  the  atom  to  the\ncosmos. Everything that is alive is an expression of this intelligence. And this intelligence oper-\nates through The Seven Spiritual Laws.\nIf you look at any cell in the human body, you will see through its functioning the expres-\nsion of these laws. Every cell, whether itís a stomach cell, or a heart cell, or a brain cell, has its\nbirth in the \nLaw of Pure Potentiality.\n DNA is a perfect example of pure potentiality; in fact, it is\nthe \nmaterial  expression\n  of  pure  potentiality.  The  same  DNA  existing  in  every  cell  expresses\nitself in different ways in order to fulfill the unique requirements of that particular cell.\nEach cell also operates through the \nLaw of Giving. \nA cell is alive and healthy when it is in\na state of balance and equilibrium. This state of equilibrium is one of fulfillment and harmony,\nbut it is maintained by a constant give and take. Each cell gives to and supports every other cell,\nand in turn is nourished by every other cell. The cell is always in a state of dynamic flow and the\nflow is never interrupted. In fact, the flow is the very essence of the life of the cell. And only by\nmaintaining this flow of giving is the cell able to receive and thus continue its vibrant existence.\nThe \nLaw of Karma\n is exquisitely executed by every cell, because built into its intelligence is\nthe most appropriate and precisely correct response to every situation as it occurs.\nThe \nLaw of Least Effort\n is also exquisitely executed by every cell in the body: it does its job\nwith quiet efficiency in the state of restful alertness.\n35\nThe  law  of  purpose  ∂","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":53}}}}],["74",{"pageContent":"Through the \nLaw of Intention and Desire,\n every intention of every cell harnesses the infi-\nnite organizing power of natureís intelligence.

It doesnít stumble or falter because its behaviour is a function of life-centered,\npresent-moment awareness.\nEach cell also expresses the \nLaw of Dharma.\n Each cell must discover its own source, the\nhigher self; it must serve its fellow beings, and express its unique talents. Heart cells, stomach\ncells, and immune cells all have their source in the higher self, the field of pure potentiality. And\nbecause they are directly linked to this cosmic computer, they can express their unique talents\nwith effortless ease and timeless awareness. Only by expressing their unique talents can they\nmaintain both their own integrity and the integrity of the whole body.

You will also see that your life becomes more joyful and abundant in every way,\nfor these laws are also the spiritual laws of life that make living worthwhile.\nThere is a natural sequence for the application of these laws in your daily life that may help\nyou to remember them. The \nLaw of Pure Potentiality\n is experienced through silence, through\nmeditation, through non-judgment, through communion with nature, but it is activated by the\nLaw  of\n  Giving.  The  principle  here  is  to  learn  to  give  that  which  you  seek.  Thatís  how  you\nactivate the \nLaw of Pure Potentiality. \nIf you seek affluence, give affluence; if you seek money,\ngive money; if you seek love, appreciation, and affection, then learn to give love, appreciation,\nand affection.\nThrough  your  actions  in  the  \nLaw  of\n  Giving  you  activate  the  \nLaw  of  Karma.\n You create\ngood karma, and good karma makes everything in life easy. You notice that you donít have to\nexpend a lot of effort to fulfill your desires, which automatically leads to an understanding of the\nLaw  of  Least  Effort.\n  When  everything  is  easy  and  effortless,  and  your  desires  keep  getting\nfulfilled, you spontaneously begin to understand the \nLaw of Intention and Desire.\n Fulfilling your\ndesires with effortless ease makes it easy for you to practice the \nLaw of Detachment.\nFinally,  as  you  begin  to  understand  all  the  above  laws,  you  begin  to  focus  on  your  true\npurpose in life, which leads to the \nLaw of Dharma.\n Through the use of this law, by expressing\nyour unique talents and fulfilling the needs of your fellow humans, you begin to create whatever\nyou want, whenever you want it. You become carefree and joyful, and your life becomes an\nexpression of unbounded love.\nWe are travellers on a cosmic journey ó star-dust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and\nwhirlpools  of  infinity.
