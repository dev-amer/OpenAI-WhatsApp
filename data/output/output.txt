INTRODUCTION
Although this book is titled The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, it could also be called The
Seven Spiritual Laws of Life, because these are the same principles that nature uses to create
everything in material existence ó everything we can see, hear, smell, taste, or touch.
In my book, Creating Affluence: Wealth Consciousness in the Field of All Possibilities, I
have outlined the steps to wealth consciousness based on a true understanding of the workings
of nature. The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success form the essence of this teaching. When this
knowledge is incorporated in your consciousness, it will give you the ability to create unlimited
wealth with effortless ease, and to experience success in every endeavour.
Success in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progres-
sive realization of worthy goals. Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease.
And yet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to be a process
that requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at the expense of others. We need a
more  spiritual  approach  to  success  and  to  affluence,  which  is  the  abundant  flow  of  all  good
things to you. With the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmony
with nature and create with carefulness, joy, and love.
There  are  many  aspects  to  success;  material  wealth  is  only  one  component.  Moreover,
success is a journey, not a destination. Material abundance, in all its expressions, happens to be
one  of  those  things  that  makes  the  journey  more  enjoyable.  But  success  also  includes  good
health, energy and enthusiasm for life, fulfilling relationships, creative freedom, emotional and
psychological stability, a sense of well-being, and peace of mind.
Even with the experience of all these things, we will remain unfulfilled unless we nurture the
seeds of divinity inside us. In reality, we are divinity in disguise, and the gods and goddesses in
embryo that are contained within us seek to be fully materialized. True success is therefore the
experience of the miraculous. It is the unfolding of the divinity within us. It is the perception of
divinity wherever we go, in whatever we perceive ó in the eyes of a child, in the beauty of a
flower, in the flight of a bird. When we begin to experience our life as the miraculous expression
of divinity ó not occasionally, but all the time ó then we will know the true meaning of success.
Before defining the seven spiritual laws, let us understand the concept of law. Law is the
process by which the unmanifest becomes the manifest; itís the process by which the observer
becomes the observed; itís the process by which the seer becomes the scenery; itís the process
through which the dreamer manifests the dream.
All of creation, everything that exists in the physical world, is the result of the unmanifest
transforming itself into the manifest. Everything that we behold comes from the unknown. Our
physical body, the physical universe ó anything and everything that we can perceive through
our senses ó is the transformation of the unmanifest, unknown, and invisible into the manifest,
known, and visible.
The physical universe is nothing other than the Self curving back within Itself to experience
Itself as spirit, mind, and physical matter. In other words, all processes of creation are processes
through which the Self or divinity expresses Itself. Consciousness in motion expresses itself as
the objects of the universe in the eternal dance of life.
The  source  of  all  creation  is  divinity  (or  the  spirit);  the  process  of  creation  is  divinity  in
motion  (or  the  mind);  and  the  object  of  creation  is  the  physical  universe  (which  includes  the
physical body).

These three components of reality ó spirit, mind, and body, or observer, the process of
observing, and the observed ó are essentially the same thing. They all come from the same
place: the field of pure potentiality which is purely unmanifest.
The physical laws of the universe are actually this whole process of divinity in motion, or
consciousness in motion. When we understand these laws and apply them in our lives, anything
we want can be created, because the same laws that nature uses to create a forest, or a galaxy,
or a star, or a human body can also bring about the fulfillment of our deepest desires.
Now letís go over The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success and see how we can apply them in
our lives.

1
The law of pure
potentiality

The source of all creation is pure consciousness, pure potentiality seeking expression from
the unmanifest to the manifest.
And when we realise that our true Self is one of pure potentiality, we align with the power
that manifests everything in the universe.
In  the  beginning  there  was  neither  existence
nor non-existence,
All this world was unmanifest energy . . .
The One breathed, without breath, by Its own
power Nothing else was there . . .
ó Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda
T
he first spiritual law of success is the Law of Pure Potentiality. This law is based on
the fact that we are, in our essential state, pure consciousness. Pure consciousness
is pure potentiality; it is the field of all possibilities and infinite creativity. Pure con-
sciousness  is  our  spiritual  essence.  Being  infinite  and  unbounded,  it  is  also  pure  joy.  Other
attributes of consciousness are pure knowledge, infinite silence, perfect balance, invincibility,
simplicity, and bliss. This is our essential nature. Our essential nature is one of pure potentiality.
When you discover your essential nature and know who you really are, in that knowing
itself  is  the  ability  to  fulfill  any  dream  you  have,  because  you  are  the  eternal  possibility,  the
immeasurable potential of all that was, is, and will be. The Law of Pure Potentiality could also be
called the Law of Unity, because underlying the infinite diversity of life is the unity of one all-
pervasive spirit. There is no separation between you and this field of energy. The field of pure
potentiality is your own Self. And the more you experience your true nature, the closer you are
to the field of pure potentiality.
The experience of the Self, or ìself-referral,î means that our internal reference point is our
own spirit, and not the objects of our experience. The opposite of self-referral is object-referral.
In object-referral we are always influenced by objects outside the Self, which include situations,
circumstances, people, and things. In object-referral we are constantly seeking the approval of
others. Our thinking and our behaviour are always in anticipation of a response. It is therefore
fear-based.
In object-referral we also feel an intense need to control things. We feel an intense need for
external power. The need for approval, the need to control things, and the need for external
power are needs that are based on fear. This kind of power is not the power of pure potentiality,
or the power of the Self, or real power. When we experience the power of the Self, there is an
absence  of  fear,  there  is  no  compulsion  to  control,  and  no  struggle  for  approval  or  external
power.
In object-referral, your internal reference point is your ego. The ego, however, is not who
you really are. The ego is your self-image; it is your social mask; it is the role you are playing.
Your social mask thrives on approval. It wants to control, and it is sustained by power, because
it lives in fear.
Your  true  Self,  which  is  your  spirit,  your  soul,  is  ^completely  free  of  those  things.  It  is
immune to criticism, it is unfearful of any challenge, and it feels beneath no one. And yet, it is
also humble and feels superior to no one, because it recognizes that everyone else is the same
Self, the same spirit in different disguises.
The  law  of  pure  potentiality∂7

Thatís the essential difference between object-referral and self-referral. In self-referral, you
experience your true being, which is unfearful of any challenge, has respect for all people, and
feels beneath no one. Self-power is therefore true power.
Power based on object-referral, however, is false power. Being ego-based power, it lasts
only  as  long  as  the  object  of  reference  is  there.  If  you  have  a  certain  title  ó  if  youíre  the
president of the country or the chairman of a corporation ó or if you have a lot of money, the
power you enjoy goes with the title, with the job, with the money. Ego-based power will only
last as long as those things last. As soon as the title, the job, the money go away, so does the
power.
Self-power, on the other hand, is permanent, because it is based on the knowledge of the
Self. And there are certain characteristics of self-power.
It draws people to you, and it also draws things that you want to you. It magnetizes people,
situations, and circumstances to support your desires. This is also called support from the laws
of nature. It is the support of divinity; it is the support that comes from being in the state of
grace. Your power is such that you enjoy a bond with people, and people enjoy a bond with
you. Your power is that of bonding ó a bonding that comes from true love.
How can we apply the Law of Pure Potentiality, the field of all possibilities, to our lives? If
you want to enjoy the benefits of the field of pure potentiality, if you want to make full use of the
creativity which is inherent in pure consciousness, then you have to have access to it. One way
to access the field is through the daily practice of silence, meditation, and non-judgment. Spending
time in nature will also give you access to the qualities inherent in the field: infinite creativity,
freedom, and bliss.
Practicing silence means making a commitment to take a certain amount of time to simply
Be.  Experiencing  silence  means  periodically  withdrawing  from  the  activity  of  speech.  It  also
means periodically withdrawing from such activities as watching television, listening to the ra-
dio, or reading a book. If you never give yourself the opportunity to experience silence, this
creates turbulence in your internal dialogue.
Set aside a little time every once in a while to experience silence. Or simply make a com-
mitment to maintain silence for a certain period each day. You could do it for two hours, or if
that seems a lot, do it for a one-hour period. And every once in a while experience silence for
an extended period of time, such as a full day, or two days, or even a whole week.
What happens when you go into this experience of silence? Initially your internal dialogue
becomes even more turbulent. You feel an intense need to say things. Iíve known people who
go absolutely crazy the first day or two when they commit themselves to an extended period of
silence. A sense of urgency and anxiety suddenly comes over them. But as they stay with the
experience, their internal dialogue begins to quieten. And soon the silence becomes profound.
This is because after a while the mind gives up; it realizes there is no point in going around and
around if you ó the Self, the spirit, the choice-maker ó are not going to speak, period. Then,
as  the  internal  dialogue  quietens,  you  begin  to  experience  the  stillness  of  the  field  of  pure
potentiality.
Practicing silence periodically as it is convenient to you is one way to experience the Law
of Pure Potentiality. Spending time each day in meditation is another. Ideally, you should medi-
tate at least thirty minutes in the morning, and thirty minutes in the evening. Through medita-
tion you will learn to experience the field of pure silence and pure awareness. In that field of
pure silence is the field of infinite correlation, the field of infinite organizing power, the ultimate
ground of creation where everything is inseparably connected with everything else.
The  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success∂ 8

In the fifth spiritual law, the Law of Intention and Desire, you will see how you can intro-
duce a faint impulse of intention in this field, and the creation of your desires will come about
spontaneously. But first, you have to experience stillness. Stillness is the first requirement for
manifesting your desires, because in stillness lies your connection to the field of pure potentiality
that can orchestrate an infinity of details for you.
Imagine throwing a little stone into a still pond and watching it ripple. Then, after a while,
when the ripples settle down, perhaps you throw another little stone. Thatís exactly what you
do when you go into the field of pure silence and introduce your intention. In this silence, even
the faintest intention will ripple across the underlying ground of universal consciousness, which
connects everything with everything else. But, if you do not experience stillness in conscious-
ness, if your mind is like a turbulent ocean, you could throw the Empire State Building into it,
and you wouldnít notice a thing. In the Bible is the expression, ìBe still, and know that I am
God.î This can only be accomplished through meditation.
Another way to access the field of pure potentiality is through the practice of non-judg-
ment. Judgment is the constant evaluation of things as right or wrong, good or bad. When you
are constantly evaluating, classifying, labeling, analyzing, you create a lot of turbulence in your
internal dialogue. This turbulence constricts the flow of energy between you and the field of
pure potentiality. You literally squeeze the ìgapî between thoughts.
The gap is your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It is that state of pure aware-
ness, that silent space between thoughts, that inner stillness that connects you to true power.
And when you squeeze the gap, you squeeze your connection to the field of pure potentiality
and infinite creativity.
There  is  a  prayer  in  A  Course  in  Miracles  that  states,  ìToday  I  shall  judge  nothing  that
occurs.î Non-judgment creates silence in your mind. It is a good idea, therefore, to begin your
day with that statement. And throughout the day, remind yourself of that statement each time
you catch yourself judging. If practicing this procedure for the whole day seems too difficult,
then you may simply say to yourself, ìFor the next two hours, I wonít judge anything,î or ìFor
the next hour, I will experience non-judgment.î Then you can extend it gradually.
Through silence, through meditation, and through non-judgment, you will access the first
law, the Law of Pure Potentiality. Once you start doing that, you can add a fourth component
to this practice, and that is regularly spending time in direct communion with nature. Spending
time in nature enables you to sense the harmonious interaction of all the elements and forces of
life, and gives you a sense of unity with all of life. Whether it be a stream, a forest, a mountain,
a lake, or the seashore, that connection with natureís intelligence will also help you access the
field of pure potentiality.
You must learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence
is beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge.
It is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment.
Access to your true essence will also give you insight into the mirror of relationship, be-
cause all relationship is a reflection of your relationship with yourself. For example, if you have
guilt, fear, and insecurity over money, or success, or anything else, then these are reflections of
guilt, fear, and insecurity as basic aspects of your personality. No amount of money or success
will solve these basic problems of existence; only intimacy with the Self will bring about true
healing. And when you are grounded in the knowledge of your true Self ó when you really
understand your true nature ó you will never feel guilty, fearful, or insecure about money, or
affluence,  or  fulfilling  your  desires,  because  you  will  realize  that  the  essence  of  all  material
wealth is life energy, it is pure potentiality. And pure potentiality is your intrinsic nature.
9The  law  of  pure  potentiality
∂

As you gain more and more access to your true nature, you will also spontaneously receive
creative thoughts, because the field of pure potentiality is also the field of infinite creativity and
pure knowledge. Franz Kafka, the Austrian philosopher and poet, once said, ìYou need not
leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. You need not even listen, simply wait.
You need not even wait, just learn to become quiet, and still, and solitary. The world will freely
offer itself to you to be unmasked. It has no choice; it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.î
The affluence of the universe ó the lavish display and abundance of the universe ó is an
expression of the creative mind of nature. The more tuned in you are to the mind of nature, the
more you have access to its infinite, unbounded creativity. But first, you have to go beyond the
turbulence of your internal dialogue to connect with that abundant, affluent, infinite, creative
mind. And then you create the possibility of dynamic activity while at the same time carrying the
stillness  of  the  eternal,  unbounded,   creative  mind.  This  exquisite  combination  of  silent,  un-
bounded, infinite mind along with dynamic, bounded, individual mind is the perfect balance of
stillness and movement simultaneously that can create whatever you want. This coexistence of
opposites ó stillness and dynamism at the same time ó makes you independent of situations,
circumstances, people, and things.
When you quietly acknowledge this exquisite coexistence of opposites, you align yourself
with the world of energy ó the quantum soup, the non-material non-stuff that is the source of
the material world. This world of energy is fluid, dynamic, resilient, changing, forever in motion.
And yet it is also non-changing, still, quiet, eternal, and silent.
Stillness alone is the potentiality for creativity; movement alone is creativity restricted to a
certain aspect of its expression. But the combination of movement and stillness enables you to
unleash your creativity in all directions ó wherever the power of your attention takes you.
Wherever you go in the midst of movement and activity, carry your stillness within you.
Then the chaotic movement around you will never overshadow your access to the reservoir of
creativity, the field of pure potentiality.
APPLYING  THE  LAW  OF  PURE  POTENTIALITY
I  will  put  the  Law  of  Pure  Potentiality  into  effect  by  making  a  commitment  to  take  the
following steps:
(1)   I will get in touch with the field of pure potentiality by taking time each day to be silent,
to just Be. I will also sit alone in silent meditation at least twice a day for approximately
thirty minutes in the morning and thirty minutes in the evening.
(2)   I will take time each day to commune with nature and to silently witness the intelli-
gence within every living thing. I will sit silently and watch a sunset, or listen to the
sound of the ocean or a stream, or simply smell the scent of a flower. In the ecstasy of
my own silence, and by communing with nature, 1 will enjoy the lire throb of ages, the
field of pure potentiality and unbounded creativity.
(3)   I will practice non-judgment. I will begin my day with the statement, ìToday, I shall
judge nothing that occurs,î and throughout the day I will remind myself not to judge.
The  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success∂10

The  Law  of
Giving

The  universe  operates  through  dynamic  ex-
change... giving and receiving are different aspects
of the flow of energy in the universe.
And  in  our  willingness  to  give  that  which  we
seek, we keep the abundance of the universe circu-
lating in our lives.
This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again,
and fillest it ever with fresh life. This little flute of a
reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast
breathed through it melodies eternally new. . . . Thy
infinite  gifts  come  to  me  only  on  those  very  small
hands  of  mine.  Ages  pass,  and  still  thou  pourest,
and still there is room to fill.
ó Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali
T
he second spiritual law of success is the Law of Giving. This law could also be called
the Law of Giving and Receiving, because the universe operates through dynamic
exchange. Nothing is static. Your body is in dynamic and constant exchange with
the body of the universe; your mind is dynamically interacting with the mind of the cosmos; your
energy is an expression of cosmic energy.
The flow of life is nothing other than the harmonious interaction of all the elements and
forces that structure the field of existence. This harmonious interaction of elements and forces
in your life operates as the Law of Giving. Because your body and your mind and the universe
are in constant and dynamic exchange, stopping the circulation of energy is like stopping the
flow of blood. Whenever blood stops flowing, it begins to clot, to coagulate, to stagnate. That is
why you must give and receive in order to keep wealth and affluence ó or anything you want in
life ó circulating in your life.
The word affluence comes from the root word ìaffluere,î which means ìto flow to.î The
word affluence means ìto flow in abundance.î Money is really a symbol of the life energy we
exchange  and  the  life  energy  we  use  as  a  result  of  the  service  we  provide  to  the  universe.
Another word for money is ìcurrency,î which also reflects the flowing nature of energy. The
word currency comes from the Latin word ìcurrereî which means ìto runî or to flow.
Therefore, if we stop the circulation of money ó if our only intention is to hold on to our
money and hoard it ó since it is life energy, we will stop its circulation back into our lives as
well. In order to keep that energy coming to us, we have to keep the energy circulating. Like a
river, money must keep flowing, otherwise it begins to stagnate, to clog, to suffocate and stran-
gle its very own life force. Circulation keeps it alive and vital.
Every relationship is one of give and take. Giving engenders receiving, and receiving en-
genders  giving.  What  goes  up  must  come  down;  what  goes  out  must  come  back.  In  reality,
receiving is the same thing as giving, because giving and receiving are different aspects of the
flow of energy in the universe. And if you stop the flow of either, you interfere with natureís
intelligence.
In every seed is the promise of thousands of forests. But the seed must not be hoarded; it
must give its intelligence to the fertile ground. Through its giving, its unseen energy flows into
material manifestation.
The  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success∂12

The more you give, the more you will receive, because you will keep the abundance of the
universe circulating in your life. In fact, anything that is of value in life only multiplies when it is
given. That which doesnít multiply through giving is neither worth giving nor worth receiving. If,
through the act of giving, you feel you have lost something, then the gift is not truly given and
will not cause increase. If you give grudgingly, there is no energy behind that giving.
It is the intention behind your giving and receiving that is the most important thing. The
intention should always be to create happiness for the giver and receiver, because happiness is
life-supporting and life-sustaining and therefore generates increase. The return is directly pro-
portional to the giving when it is unconditional and from the heart. That is why the act of giving
has to be joyful ó the frame of mind has to be one in which you feel joy in the very act of giving.
Then the energy behind the giving increases many times over.
Practicing the Law of Giving is actually very simple: if you want joy, give joy to others; if
you want love, learn to give love; if you want attention and appreciation, learn to give attention
and appreciation; if you want material affluence, help others to become materially affluent. In
fact, the easiest way to get what you want is to help others get what they want. This principle
works equally well for individuals, corporations, societies, and nations. If you want to be blessed
with all the good things in life, learn to silently bless everyone with all the good things in life.
Even the thought of giving, the thought of blessing, or a simple prayer has the power to
affect others. This is because our body, reduced to its essential state, is a localized bundle of
energy and information in a universe of energy and information. We are localized bundles of
consciousness in a conscious universe. The word ìconsciousnessî implies more than just energy
and information ó it implies energy and information which is alive as thought. Therefore we
are bundles of thought in a thinking universe. And thought has the power to transform.
Life is the eternal dance of consciousness that expresses itself as the dynamic exchange of
impulses of intelligence between microcosm and macrocosm, between the human body and the
universal body, between the human mind and the cosmic mind.
When you learn to give that which you seek, you activate and choreograph the dance with
an exquisite, energetic, and vital movement that constitutes the eternal throb of life.
The  best  way  to  put  the  Law  of  Giving  into  operation  ó  to  start  the  whole  process  of
circulation ó is to make a decision that any time you come into contact with anyone, you will
give them something. It doesnít have to be in the form of material things; it could be a flower, a
compliment, or a prayer. In fact, the most powerful forms of giving are non-material. The gifts
of caring, attention, affection, appreciation, and love are some of the most precious gifts you
can give, and they donít cost you anything.
When you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness,
joy, and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful.
One of the things I was taught as a child, and which I taught my children also, is never to go
to anyoneís house without bringing something ó never visit anyone without bringing them a
gift. You may say, ìHow can I give to others when at the moment I donít have enough myself?î
You can bring a flower. One flower. You can bring a note or a card which says something about
your  feelings  for  the  person  youíre  visiting.  You  can  bring  a  compliment.  You  can  bring  a
prayer.
Make a decision to give wherever you go, to whomever you see. As long as youíre giving,
you will be receiving. The more you give, the more confidence you will gain in the miraculous
effects of this law. And as you receive more, your ability to give more will also increase.
Our true nature is one of affluence and abundance; we are naturally affluent because nature
supports every need and desire. We lack nothing, because our essential nature is one of pure
13The  law  of  Giving

potentiality and infinite possibilities. Therefore, you must know that you are already inherently
affluent, no matter how much or how little money you have, because the source of all wealth is
the  field  of  pure  potentiality  ó  it  is  the  consciousness  that  knows  how  to  fulfill  every  need,
including joy, love, laughter, peace, harmony, and knowledge. If you seek these things first ó
not only for yourself, but for others ó all else will come to you spontaneously.
APPLYING  THE  LAW   OF   GIVING
I will put the Law of Giving into effect by making a commitment to take the following steps:
(1)   Wherever I go, and whoever I encounter, I will bring them a gift. The gift may be a
compliment, a flower, or a prayer. Today, I will give something to everyone I come into
contact with, and so I will begin the process of circulating joy, wealth and affluence in
my life and in the lives of others.
(2)   Today I will gratefully receive all the gifts that life has to offer me. I will receive the gifts
of nature: sunlight and the sound of birds singing, or spring showers or the first snow
of winter. I will also be open to receiving from others, whether it be in the form of a
material gift, money, a compliment, or a prayer.
(3)   I will make a commitment to keep wealth circulating in my life by giving and receiving
lifeís most precious gifts: the gifts of caring, affection, appreciation, and love. Each
time I meet someone, I will silently wish them happiness, joy, and laughter.

The law
of ìkarmaî
or cause
and  effect

Every  action  generates  a  force  of  energy  that
returns to us in like kind . . . what we sow is what we
reap.
And when we choose actions that bring happi-
ness and success to others, the fruit of our karma is
happiness and success.
Karma is the eternal assertion of human free-
dom. . . . Our thoughts, our words, and deeds are
the threads of the net which we throw around our-
selves.
ó Swami Vivekananda
T
he third spiritual law of success is the Law of Karma. ìKarmaî is both action and the
consequence  of  that  action;  it  is  cause  and  effect  simultaneously,  because  every
action generates a force of energy that returns to us in like kind. There is nothing
unfamiliar about the Law of Karma. Everyone has heard the expression, ìWhat you sow is what
you reap.î Obviously, if we want to create happiness in our lives, we must learn to sow the
seeds of happiness. Therefore, karma implies the action of conscious choice-making.
You and I are essentially infinite choice-makers. In every moment of our existence, we are
in that field of all possibilities where we have access to an infinity of choices. Some of these
choices are made consciously, while others are made unconsciously. But the best way to under-
stand and maximize the use of karmic law is to become consciously aware of the choices we
make in every moment.
Whether you like it or not, everything that is happening at this moment is a result of the
choices youíve made in the past. Unfortunately, a lot of us make choices unconsciously, and
therefore we donít think they are choices ó and yet, they are.
If I were to insult you, you would most likely make the choice of being offended. If I were to
pay you a compliment, you would most likely make the choice of being pleased or flattered. But
think about it: itís still a choice.
I  could  offend  you  and  I  could  insult  you,  and  you  could  make  the  choice  of  not  being
offended. I could pay you a compliment and you could make the choice of not letting that flatter
you either.
In other words, most of us ó even though we are infinite choice-makers ó have become
bundles of conditioned reflexes that are constantly being triggered by people and circumstances
into  predictable  outcomes  of  behaviour.  These  conditioned  reflexes  are  like  Pavlovian  condi-
tioning. Pavlov is famous for demonstrating that if you give a dog something to eat every time
you  ring  a  bell,  soon  the  dog  starts  to  salivate  when  you  just  ring  the  bell,  because  it  has
associated one stimulus with the other.
Most of us, as a result of conditioning, have repetitions and predictable responses to the
stimuli  in  our  environment.  Our  reactions  seem  to  be  automatically  triggered  by  people  and
circumstances, and we forget that these are still choices that we are making in every moment of
our existence. We are simply making these choices unconsciously.
If you step back for a moment and witness the choices you are making as you make those
choices, then in just this act of witnessing, you take the whole process from the unconscious
The  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success∂16

realm into the conscious realm. This procedure of conscious choice-making and witnessing is
very empowering.
When you make any choice ó any choice at all ó you can ask yourself two things: First of
all, ìWhat are the consequences of this choice that Iím making?î In your heart you will immedi-
ately know what these are. Secondly, ìWill this choice that Iím making now bring happiness to
me and to those around me?î If the answer is yes, then go ahead with that choice. If the answer
is no, if that choice brings distress either to you or to those around you, then donít make that
choice. Itís as simple as that.
There is only one choice, out of the infinity of choices available in every second, that will
create happiness for you as well as for those around you. And when you make that one choice,
it will result in a form of behaviour that is called spontaneous right action. Spontaneous right
action  is  the  right  action  at  the  right  moment.  Itís  the  right  response  to  every  situation  as  it
happens. Itís the action that nourishes you and everyone else who is influenced by that action.
There is a very interesting mechanism that the universe has to help you make spontane-
ously  correct  choices.  The  mechanism  has  to  do  with  sensations  in  your  body.  Your  body
experiences two kinds of sensations: one is a sensation of comfort, the other is a sensation of
discomfort. At the moment you consciously make a choice, pay attention to your body and ask
your body, ìIf I make this choice, what happens?î If your body sends a message of comfort,
thatís the right choice. If your body sends a message of discomfort, then itís not the appropriate
choice.
For some people the message of comfort and discomfort is in the area of the solar plexus,
but for most people itís in the area of the heart. Consciously put your attention in the heart and
ask your heart what to do. Then wait for the response ó a physical response in the form of a
sensation. It may be the .faintest level of feeling ó but itís there, in your body.
Only the heart knows the correct answer. Most people think the heart is mushy and senti-
mental. But itís not. The heart is intuitive; itís holistic, itís contextual, itís relational. It doesnít
have a win-lose orientation. It taps into the cosmic computer ó the field of pure potentiality,
pure knowledge, and infinite organizing power ó and takes everything into account. At times it
may not even seem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurate and
far more precise than anything within the limits of rational thought.
You can use the Law of Karma to create money and affluence, and the flow of all good
things to you, any time you want. But first, you must become consciously aware that your future
is generated by the choices you are making in every moment of your life. If you do this on a
regular  basis,  then  you  are  making  full  use  of  the  Law  of  Karma.  The  more  you  bring  your
choices into the level of your conscious awareness, the more you will make those choices which
are spontaneously correct ó both for you and those around you.
What about past karma and how it is influencing you now? There are three things you can
do  about  past  karma.  One  is  to  pay  your  karmic  debts.  Most  people  choose  to  do  that  ó
unconsciously,  of  course.  This  may  be  a  choice  you  make,  also.  Sometimes  thereís  a  lot  of
suffering involved in the payment of those debts, but the Law of Karma says no debt in the
universe ever goes unpaid. There is a perfect accounting system in this universe, and everything
is a constant ìto and froî exchange of energy.
The second thing you can do is to transmute or transform your karma to a more desirable
experience. This is a very interesting process in which you ask yourself, as youíre paying your
karmic debt, ìWhat can I learn from this experience? Why is this happening and what is the
message that the universe is giving to me? How can I make this experience useful to my fellow
human beings?î
17The  law  of  Carma  or  Cause  and  Effect
∂

By doing this, you look for the seed of opportunity and then tie that seed of opportunity
with your dharma, with your purpose in life, which weíll talk about in the Seventh Spiritual Law
of Success. This allows you to transmute the karma to a new expression.
For example, if you break your leg while playing sports, you might ask, ìWhat can I learn
from this experience? What is the message that the universe is giving me?î Perhaps the mes-
sage is that you need to slow down and be more careful or attentive to your body the next time.
And if your dharma is to teach others what you know, then by asking, ìHow can I make this
experience useful to my fellow human beings?î you may decide to share what you learned by
writing a book about playing sports safely. Or you may design a special shoe or leg support that
prevents the kind of injury you experienced.
This way, while paying your karmic debt, you will have also converted the adversity into a
benefit that may bring you wealth and fulfillment. This is the transmutation of your karma into
a positive experience. You havenít really gotten rid of your karma, but you are able to take a
karmic episode and create a new and positive karma out of it.
The  third  way  to  deal  with  karma  is  to  transcend  it.  To  transcend  karma  is  to  become
independent of it. The way to transcend karma is to keep experiencing the gap, the Self, the
Spirit. Itís like washing a dirty piece of cloth in a stream of water. Every time you wash it, you
take  away  a  few  stains.  You  keep  washing  it  again  and  again,  and  each  time  it  gets  a  little
cleaner. You wash or transcend the seeds of your karma by going into the gap and coming out
again. This, of course, is done through the practice of meditation.
All actions are karmic episodes. Drinking a cup of coffee is a karmic episode. That action
generates  memory,  and  memory  has  the  ability  or  the  potentiality  to  generate  desire.  And
desire generates action again. The operational software of your soul is karma, memory, and
desire. Your soul is a bundle of consciousness that has the seeds of karma, memory, and desire.
By becoming conscious of these seeds of manifestation, you become a conscious generator of
reality. By becoming a conscious choice-maker, you begin to generate actions that are evolu-
tionary for you and for those that are around you. And thatís all you need to do.
As long as karma is evolutionary ó for both the Self and everyone affected by the Self ó
then the fruit of karma will be happiness and success.
APPLYING THE LAW  OF KARMA  OR  CAUSE  AND  EFFECT
I  will  put  the  Law  of  Karma  into  effect  by  making  a  commitment  to  take  the  following
steps:
(1)   Today I will witness the choices I make in each moment. And in the mere witnessing of
these choices, I will bring them to my conscious awareness. I will know that the best
way to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.
(2)   Whenever  I  make  a  choice,  I  will  ask  myself  two  questions:  ìWhat  are  the  conse-
quences of this choice that Iím making?î and ìWill this choice bring fulfillment and
happiness to me and also to those who are affected by this choice?î
(3)   I  will  then  ask  my  heart  for  guidance  and  be  guided  by  its  message  of  comfort  or
discomfort. If the choice feels comfortable, I will plunge ahead with abandon. If the
choice feels uncomfortable, I will pause and see the consequences of my action with
my inner vision. This guidance will enable me to make spontaneously correct choices
for myself and for all those around me.

The law of least
effort

Nature  5  intelligence  functions  with  effortless
ease . . . with carefreeness, harmony, and love.
And when we harness the forces of harmony,
joy,  and  love,  we  create  success  and  good  fortune
with effortless ease.
An  integral  being  knows  without  going,  sees
without looking, and accomplishes without doing.
ó Lao T
ZU
T
he fourth spiritual law of success is the Law of Least Effort. This law is based on the
fact that natureís intelligence functions with effortless ease and abandoned careful
ness.  This  is  the  principle  of  least  action,  of  no  resistance.  This  is,  therefore,  the
principle  of  harmony  and  love.  When  we  learn  this  lesson  from  nature,  we  easily  fulfill  our
desires.
If you observe nature at work, you will see that least effort is expended. Grass doesnít try to
grow,  it  just  grows.  Fish  donít  try  to  swim,  they  just  swim.  Flowers  donít  try  to  bloom,  they
bloom. Birds donít try to fly, they fly. This is their intrinsic nture. The earth doesnít try to spin
on its own axis; it is the nature of the earth to spin with dizzying speed and to hurtle through
space. It is the nature of babies to be in bliss. It is the nature of the sun to shine. It is the nature
of the stars to glitter and sparkle. And it is human nature to make our dreams manifest into
physical form, easily and effortlessly.
In Vedic Science, the age-old philosophy of India, this principle is known as the principle of
economy of effort, or ìdo less and accomplish more.î Ultimately you come to the state where
you do nothing and accomplish everything. This means that there is just a faint idea, and then
the manifestation of the idea comes about effortlessly. What is commonly called a ìmiracleî is
actually an expression of the Law of Least Effort.
Natureís intelligence functions effortlessly, fric-tionlessly, spontaneously. It is non-linear; it
is intuitive, holistic, and nourishing. And when you are in harmony with nature, when you are
established in the knowledge of your true self, you can make use or the Law of Least Effort.
Least effort is expended when your actions are motivated by love, because nature is held
together by the energy of love. When you seek power and control over other people, you waste
energy. When you seek money or power for the sake of the ego, you spend energy chasing the
illusion of happiness instead of enjoying happiness in the moment. When you seek money for
personal gain only, you cut off the flow of energy to yourself, and interfere with the expression
of  natureís  intelligence.  But  when  your  actions  are  motivated  by  love,  there  is  no  waste  of
energy. When your actions are motivated by love, your energy multiplies and accumulates ó
and the surplus energy you gather and enjoy can be channeled to create anything that you want,
including unlimited wealth.
You can think of your physical body as a device for controlling energy: it can generate,
store, and expend energy. If you know how to generate, store, and expend energy in an effi-
cient  way,  then  you  can  create  any  amount  of  wealth.  Attention  to  the  ego  consumes  the
greatest  amount  of  energy.  When  your  internal  reference  point  is  the  ego,  when  you  seek
power  and  control  over  other  people  or  seek  approval  from  others,  you  spend  energy  in  a
wasteful way.
When that energy is freed up, it can be rechanneled and used to create anything that you
want. When your internal reference point is your spirit, when you are immune to criticism and
unfearful of any challenge, you can harness the power of love, and use energy creatively for the
experience of affluence and evolution.
The  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success∂20

In The Art of Dreaming, Don Juan tells Carlos Castaneda, ì. . . most of our energy goes
into upholding our importance. ... If we were capable of losing some of that importance, two
extraordinary things would happen to us: One, we would free our energy from trying to main-
tain the illusory idea of our grandeur; and two, we would provide ourselves with enough energy
to catch a glimpse or the actual grandeur of the universe.î
There are three components to the Law of Least Effort ó three things you can do to put
this principle of ìdo less and accomplish moreî into action. The first component is acceptance.
Acceptance  simply  means  that  you  make  a  commitment:  ìToday  I  will  accept  people,  situa-
tions, circumstances, and events as they occur.î This means I will know that this moment is as
it  should  be,  because  the  whole  universe  is  as  it  should  be.  This  moment  ó  the  one  youíre
experiencing right now ó is the culmination of all the moments you have experienced in the
past. This moment is as it is because the entire universe is as it is.
When you struggle against this moment, youíre actually struggling against the entire uni-
verse. Instead, you can make the decision that today you will not struggle against the whole
universe by struggling against this moment. 1 his means that your acceptance of this moment is
total and complete. You accept things as they are, not as you wish they were in this moment.
This is important to understand. You can wish for things in the future to be different, but in this
moment you have to accept things as they are.
When you feel frustrated or upset by a person or a situation, remember that you are not
reacting to the person or the situation, but to your feelings about the person or the situation.
These are your feelings, and your feelings are not someone elseís fault. When you recognize
and understand this completely, you are ready to take responsibility for how you feel and to
change it. And if you can accept things as they are, you are ready to take responsibility for your
situation and for all the events you see as problems.
This leads us to the second component of the Law of Least Effort: responsibility. What
does responsibility mean? Responsibility means not blaming anyone or anything for your situa-
tion, including yourself. Having accepted this circumstance, this event, this problem, responsi-
bility then means the ability to have a creative response to the situation as it is now. All prob-
lems contain the seeds of opportunity, and this awareness allows you to take the moment and
transform it to a better situation or thing.
Once you do this, every so-called upsetting situation will become an opportunity for the
creation of something new and beautiful, and every so-called tormentor or tyrant will become
your teacher. Reality is an interpretation. And if you choose to interpret reality in this way, you
will have many teachers around you, and many opportunities to evolve.
Whenever  confronted  by  a  tyrant,  tormentor,  teacher,  friend,  or  foe  (they  all  mean  the
same thing) remind yourself, ìThis moment is as it should be.î Whatever relationships you have
attracted in your life at this moment are precisely the ones you need in your life at this moment.
There  is  a  hidden  meaning  behind  all  events,  and  this  hidden  meaning  is  serving  your  own
evolution.
The third component of the Law of Least Effort is defencelessness, which means that your
awareness is established in defenselessness, and you have relinquished the need to convince or
persuade others of your point of view. If you observe people around you, youíll see that they
spend ninety-nine percent of their time defending their points of view. If you just relinquish the
need to defend your point of view, you will in that relinquishment, gain access to enormous
amounts of energy that have been previously wasted.
When you become defensive, blame others, and do not accept and surrender to the mo-
ment, your life meets resistance. Any time you encounter resistance, recognize that if you force
the situation, the resistance will only increase. You donít want to stand rigid like a tall oak that
cracks and collapses in the storm. Instead, you want to be flexible, like a reed that bends with
the storm and survives.
Completely desist from defending your point of view. When you have no point to defend,
you do not allow the birth of an argument. If you do this consistently ó if you stop fighting and
21The  law  of  least  effort
∂

resisting ó you will fully experience the present, which is a gift. Someone once told me, ìThe
past is history, the future is a mystery, and this moment is a gift. That is why this moment is
called ëthe presentí.î
If you embrace the present and become one with it, and merge with it, you will experience
a  fire,  a  glow,  a  sparkle  of  ecstasy  throbbing  in  every  living  sentient  being.  As  you  begin  to
experience this exultation of spirit in everything that is alive, as you become intimate with it, joy
will be born within you, and you will drop the terrible burdens and encumbrances of defensive-
ness, resentment, and hurtfulness. Only then will you become light-hearted, carefree, joyous,
and free.
In this joyful, simple freedom, you will know without any doubt in your heart that what you
want  is  available  to  you  whenever  you  want  it,  because   your  want  will  be  from  the  level  of
happiness, not from the level of anxiety or fear. You do not need to justify; simply declare your
intent to yourself, and you will experience fulfillment, delight, joy, freedom, and autonomy in
every moment of your life.
Make a commitment to follow the path of no resistance. This is the path through which
natureís intelligence unfolds spontaneously, without friction or effort. When you have the exqui-
site  combination  of  acceptance,  responsibility,  and  defenselessness,  you  will  experience  life
flowing with effortless ease.
When you remain open to all points of view ó not rigidly attached to only one ó your
dreams and desires will flow with natureís desires. Then you can release your intentions, with-
out attachment, and just wait for the appropriate season for your desires to blossom into reality.
You can be sure that when the season is right, your desires will manifest. This is the Law of
Least Effort.
APPLYING  THE  LAW  OF  LEAST  EFFORT
I will put the Law of Least Effort into effect by making a commitment to take the following
steps:
(1)   I will practice Acceptance. Today I will accept people, situations, circumstances, and
events as they occur. I will know that this moment is as it should be, because the whole
universe is as it should be. I will not struggle against the whole universe by struggling
against this moment. My acceptance is total and complete. I accept things as they are
this moment, not as I wish they were.
(2)   Having accepted things as they are, I will take Responsibility for my situation and for
all those events I see as problems. I know that taking responsibility means not blaming
anyone or anything for my situation (and this includes myself). I also know that every
problem is an opportunity in disguise, and this alertness to opportunities allows me to
take this moment and transform it into a greater benefit.
(3)   Today my awareness will remain established in Defenselessness. I will relinquish the
need to defend my point of view. I will feel no need to convince or persuade others to
accept my point of view. I will remain open to all points of view and not be rigidly
attached to any one of them.

THE LAW of
INTENTION  and
DESIRE

Inherent  in  every  intention  and  desire  is  the
mechanics for its fulfillment. . . intention and desire
in the field of pure potentiality have infinite organiz-
ing power.
And when we introduce an intention in the fer-
tile ground of pure potentiality, we put this infinite
organiyng power to work for us.
In  the  beginning  there  was  desire,  which  was
the  first  seed  of  mind;  sages,  having  meditated  in
their  hearts,  have  discovered  by  their  wisdom  the
connection of the existent with the non-existent.
ó The Hymn of Creation, The Rig Veda
T
he fifth spiritual law of success is the Law of Intention and Desire. This law is based
on the fact that energy and information exist everywhere in nature. In fact, at the
level of the quantum field, there is nothing other than energy and information. The
quantum field is just another label for the field of pure consciousness or pure potentiality. And
this quantum field is influenced by intention and desire. Letís examine this process in detail.
A flower, a rainbow, a tree, a blade of grass, a human body, when broken down to their
essential components, are energy and information. The whole universe, in its essential nature,
is the movement of energy and information. The only difference between you and a tree is the
informational and energy content of your respective bodies.
On the material level, both you and the tree are made up of the same recycled elements:
mostly carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements in minute amounts. You could
buy these elements in a hardware store for a couple of dollars. The difference, therefore, be-
tween you and the tree is not the carbon, or the hydrogen, or the oxygen. In fact; you and the
tree are constantly exchanging your carbon and oxygen with each other. The real difference
between the two of you is in the energy and in the information.
In the scheme of nature, you and I are a privileged species. We have a nervous system that
is capable of becoming aware of the energy and informational content of that localized field that
gives  rise  to  our  physical  body.  We  experience  this  field  subjectively  as  our  own  thoughts,
feelings, emotions, desires, memories, instincts, drives, and beliefs. This same field is experi-
enced objectively as the physical body ó and through the physical body, we experience this
field as the world. But itís all the same stuff. That is why the ancient seers exclaimed, ìI am that,
you are that, all this is that, and thatís all there is.î
Your body is not separate from the body of the universe, because at quantum mechanical
levels there are no well-defined edges. You are like a wiggle, a wave, a fluctuation, a convolu-
tion, a whirlpool, a localized disturbance in the larger quantum field. The larger quantum field
ó the universe ó is your extended body.
Not only is the human nervous system capable of becoming aware of the information and
energy of its own quantum field, but because human consciousness is infinitely flexible through
this wonderful nervous system, you are able to consciously change the informational content
that gives rise to your physical body. You can consciously change the energy and informational
content or your own quantum mechanical body, and therefore influence the energy and infor-
The  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success∂24

mational content of your extended body ó your environment, your world ó and cause things
to manifest in it.
This  conscious  change  is  brought  about  by  the  two  qualities  inherent  in  consciousness:
attention and intention. Attention energizes, and intention transforms. Whatever you put your
attention on will grow stronger in your life. Whatever you take your attention away from will
wither,  disintegrate,  and  disappear.  Intention,  on  the  other  hand,  triggers  transformation  of
energy and information. Intention organizes its own fulfillment.
The quality of intention on the object of attention will orchestrate an infinity of space-time
events to bring about the outcome intended, provided one follows the other spiritual laws of
success. This is because intention in the fertile ground of attention has infinite organizing power.
Infinite organizing power means the power to organize an infinity of space-time events, all at
the same time. We see the expression of this infinite organizing power in every blade of grass,
in every apple blossom, in every cell of our body. We see it in everything that is alive.
In  the  scheme  of  nature,  everything  correlates  and  connects  with  everything  else.  The
groundhog comes out of the earth and you know it is going to be spring. Birds begin to migrate
in a certain direction at a certain time of the year. Nature is a symphony. And that symphony is
being silently orchestrated at the ultimate ground of creation.
The human body is another good example of this symphony. A single cell in the human
body is doing about six trillion things per second, and it has to know what every other cell is
doing at the same time. The human body can play music, kill germs, make a baby, recite poetry,
and monitor the movement of stars all at the same time, because the field of infinite correlation
is part of its information field.
What is remarkable about the nervous system of the human species is that it can command
this infinite organizing power through conscious intent. Intent in the human species is not fixed
or  locked  into  a  rigid  network  of  energy  and  information.  It  has  infinite  flexibility.  In  other
words,  as  long  as  you  do  not  violate  the  other  laws  of  nature,  through  your  intent  you  can
literally command the laws of nature to fulfill your dreams and desires.
You can put the cosmic computer with its infinite organizing power to work for you. You
can go to that ultimate ground of creation and introduce an intention, and just by introducing
the intention, you activate the field of infinite correlation.
Intention  lays  the  groundwork  for  the  effortless,  spontaneous,  frictionless  flow  of  pure
potentiality seeking expression from the unmanifest to the manifest. The only caution is that
you use your intent for the benefit of mankind. This happens spontaneously when you are in
alignment with The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success.
Intention is the real power behind desire. Intent alone is very powerful, because intent is
desire without attachment to the outcome. Desire alone is weak, because desire in most people
is  attention  with  attachment.  Intent  is  desire  with  strict  adherence  to  all  the  other  laws,  but
particularly the Law of Detachment, which is the Sixth Spiritual Law of Success.
Intention  combined  with  detachment  leads  to  life-centered,  present-moment  awareness.
And when action is performed in present-moment awareness, it is most effective. Your intent is
for the future, but your attention is in the present. As long as your attention is in the present,
then your intent for the future will manifest, because the future is created in the present. You
must accept the present as is. Accept the present and intend the future. The future is something
you can always create through detached intention, but you should never struggle against the
present.
25The  law  of  Intention  and  Desire∂

The past, present, and future are all properties of consciousness. The past is recollection,
memory; the future is anticipation; the present is awareness. Therefore time is the movement
of thought. Both past and future are born in the imagination; only the present, which is aware-
ness, is real and eternal. It is. It is the potentiality for space-time, matter, and energy. It is an
eternal field of possibilities experiencing itself as abstract forces, whether they be light, heat,
electricity, magnetism, or gravity. These forces are neither in the past nor in the future. They
just are.
Our interpretation of these abstract forces gives us the experience of concrete phenomena
and  form.  Remembered  interpretations  of  abstract  forces  create  the  experience  of  the  past,
anticipatory interpretations of the same abstract forces create the future. They are the qualities
of attention in consciousness. When these qualities are freed from the burden of the past, then
action in the present becomes the fertile ground for the creation of the future.
Intention, grounded in this detached freedom of the present, serves as the catalyst for the
right mix of matter, energy, and space-time events to create whatever it is that you desire.
If  you  have  life-centered,  present-moment  awareness,  then  the  imaginary  obstacles  ó
which are more than ninety percent of perceived obstacles ó disintegrate and disappear. The
remaining five to ten percent of perceived obstacles can be transmuted into opportunities through
one-pointed intention.
One-pointed intention is that quality of attention that is unbending in its fixity of purpose.
One-pointed  intention  means  holding  your  attention  to  the  intended  outcome  with  such  un-
bending  purpose  that  you  absolutely  refuse  to  allow  obstacles  to  consume  and  dissipate  the
focused quality of your attention. There is a total and complete exclusion of all obstacles from
your consciousness. You are able to maintain an unshakable serenity while being committed to
your  goal  with  intense  passion.  This  is  the  power  of  detached  awareness  and  one-pointed,
focused intention simultaneously.
Learn to harness the power of intention, and you can create anything you desire. You can
still get results through effort and through trying, but at a cost. The cost is stress, heart attacks,
and the compromised function of your immune system. It is much better to execute the follow-
ing five steps in the Law of Intention and Desire. When you follow these five steps for fulfilling
your desires, intention generates its own power:
(1)   Slip into the gap. This means to center yourself in that silent space between thoughts,
to go into the silence ó that level of Being which is your essential state.
(2)   Established in that state of Being, release your intentions and desires. When you are
actually in the gap, thereís no thought, thereís no intention, but as you come out of the
gap ó at that junction between the gap and a thought ó you introduce the intention.
If  you  have  a  series  of  goals,  you  can  write  them  down,  and  have  your   intention
focused  on  them  before  you  go  into  the  gap.  If  you  want  a  successful  career,  for
example,  you  go  into  the  gap  with  that  intention,  and  the  intention  will  already  be
there as a faint flicker in your awareness. Releasing your intentions and desires in the
gap means planting them in the fertile ground of pure potentiality, and expecting them
to bloom when the season is right. You do not want to dig up the seeds of your desires
to see if they are growing, or get rigidly attached to the way in which they will unfold.
You simply want to release them.
(3)   Remain in the state of self-referral. This means remain established in the awareness of
your true Self ó your spirit, your connection to the field of pure potentiality. It also
The  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success∂26

means not to look at yourself through the eyes of the world, or allow yourself to be
influenced  by  the  opinions  and  criticisms  of  others.  A  helpful  way  to  maintain  that
state of self-referral is to keep your desires to yourself; do not share them with anyone
else unless they share the exact same desires that you have and are closely bonded
with you.
(4)   Relinquish your attachment to the outcome. This means giving up your rigid attach-
ment to a specific result and living in the wisdom of uncertainty. It means enjoying
every moment in the journey of your life, even if you donít know the outcome.
(5)   Let the universe handle the details. Your intentions and desires, when released in the
gap, have infinite organizing power. Trust that infinite organizing power of intention
to orchestrate all the details for you.
Remember that your true nature is one of pure spirit. Carry the consciousness of your spirit
wherever you go, gently release your desires, and the universe will handle the details for you.
APPLYING  THE  LAW  OF  INTENTION  AND  DESIRE
I will put the Law of Intention and Desire into effect by making a commitment to take the
following steps:
(1)   I will make a list of all my desires. I will carry this list with me wherever I go. I will look
at this list before I go into my silence and meditation. I will look at it before I go to sleep
at night. I will look at it when I wake up in the morning.
(2)   I will release this list of my desires and surrender it to the womb of creation, trusting
that when things donít seem to go my way, there is a reason, and that the cosmic plan
has designs for me much grander than even those that I have conceived.
(3)   I  will  remind  myself  to  practice  present-moment  awareness  in  all  my  actions.  I  will
refuse to allow obstacles to consume and dissipate the quality of my attention in the
present moment. I will accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through my
deepest, most cherished intentions and desires.

THE LAW of
DETACHMENT

In detachment lies the wisdom of uncertainty,
in the wisdom of uncertainty lies the freedom from
our  past,  from  the  known,  which  is  the  prison  of
past conditioning.
And in our willingness to step into the unknown,
the field of all possibilities, we surrender ourselves to
the creative mind that orchestrates the dance of the
universe.
Like two golden birds perched on the selfsame
tree, intimate friends, the ego and the Self dwell in
the same body. The former eats the sweet and sour
fruits of the tree of life, while the latter looks on in
detachment.
ó The Mundaka Upanishad
T
he sixth spiritual law of success is the Law of Detachment. The Law of Detachment
says that in order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquish
your attachment to it. This doesnít mean you give up the intention to create your
desire.  You  donít  give  up  the  intention,  and  you  donít  give  up  the  desire.  You  give  up  your
attachment to the result.
This a very powerful thing to do. The moment you relinquish your attachment to the result,
combining one-pointed intention with detachment at the same time, you will have that which
you desire. Anything you want can be acquired through detachment, because detachment is
based on the unquestioning belief in the power of your true Self.
Attachment, on the other hand, is based on fear and insecurity ó and the need for security
is based on not knowing the true Self. The source of wealth, of abundance, or of anything in the
physical world is the Self; it is the consciousness that knows how to fulfill every need. Everything
else is a symbol: cars, houses, bank notes, clothes, airplanes. Symbols are transitory; they come
and go. Chasing symbols is like settling for the map instead of the territory. It creates anxiety; it
ends  up  making  you  feel  hollow  and  empty  inside,  because  you  exchange  your  Self  for  the
symbols of your Self.
Attachment comes from poverty consciousness, because attachment is always to symbols.
Detachment is synonymous with wealth consciousness, because with detachment there is free-
dom  to  create.  Only  from  detached  involvement  can  one  have  joy   and  laughter.  Then  the
symbols of wealth are created spontaneously and effortlessly. Without detachment we are pris-
oners of helplessness, hopelessness, mundane needs, trivial concerns, quiet desperation, and
seriousness ó the distinctive features of everyday mediocre existence and poverty conscious-
ness.
True wealth consciousness is the ability to have anything you want, anytime you want, and
with least effort. To be grounded in this experience you have to be grounded in the wisdom of
uncertainty. In this uncertainty you will find the freedom to create anything you want.
People are constantly seeking security, and you will find that seeking security is actually a
very ephemeral thing. Even attachment to money is a sign of insecurity. You might say, ìWhen
I have X million dollars, then Iíll be secure. Then Iíll be financially independent and I will retire.
Then I will do all the things I really want to do.î But it never happens ó never happens.
29The  law  of  pure  Detachment∂

Those who seek security chase it for a lifetime without ever finding it. it remains elusive and
ephemeral,  because  security  can  never  come  from  money  alone.  Attachment  to  money  will
always create insecurity no matter how much money you have in the bank. In fact, some of the
people who have the most money are the most insecure.
The  search  for  security  is  an  illusion.  In  ancient  wisdom  traditions,  the  solution  to  this
whole dilemma lies in the wisdom of insecurity, or the wisdom of uncertainty. This means that
the search for security and certainty is actually an attachment to the known. And whatís the
known?  The  known  is  our  past.  The  known  is  nothing  other  than  the  prison  of  past  con-
ditioning. Thereís no evolution in that ó absolutely none at all. And when there is no evolution,
there is stagnation, entropy, disorder, and decay.
Uncertainty, on the other hand, is the fertile ground of pure creativity and freedom. Uncer-
tainty means stepping into the unknown in every moment of our existence. The unknown is the
field of all possibilities, ever fresh, ever new, always open to the creation ot new manifestations.
Without uncertainty and the unknown, life is just the stale repetition of outworn memories. You
become the victim of the past, and your tormentor today is your self left over from yesterday.
Relinquish your attachment to the known, step into the unknown, and you will step into the
field of all possibilities. In your willingness to step into the unknown, you will have the wisdom
of uncertainty factored in. This means that in every moment of your life, you will have excite-
ment, adventure, mystery. You will experience the fun of life ó the magic, the celebration, the
exhilaration, and the exultation of your own spirit.
Every day you can look for the excitement of what may occur in the field of all possibilities.
When you experience uncertainty, you are on the right path ó so donít give it up. You donít
need to have a complete and rigid idea of what youíll be doing next week or next year, because
if you have a very clear idea of whatís going to happen and you get rigidly attached to it, then
you shut out a whole range of possibilities.
One characteristic of the field of all possibilities is infinite correlation. The field can orches-
trate an infinity of space-time events to bring about the outcome that is intended. But when you
are attached, your intention gets locked into a rigid mindset and you lose the fluidity, the crea-
tivity, and the spontaneity inherent in the field. When you get attached, you freeze your desire
from that infinite fluidity and flexibility into a rigid framework which interferes with the whole
process of creation.
The Law of Detachment does not interfere with the Law of Intention and Desire ó with
goal-setting. You still have the intention of going in a certain direction, you still have a goal.
However, between point A and point B there are infinite possibilities. With uncertainty factored
in, you might change direction in any moment if you find a higher ideal, or if you find something
more exciting. You are also less likely to force solutions on problems, which enables you to stay
alert to opportunities.
The Law of Detachment accelerates the whole process of evolution. When you understand
this law, you donít feel compelled to force solutions. When you force solutions on problems,
you only create new problems. But when you put your attention on the uncertainty, and you
witness the uncertainty while you expectantly wait for the solution to emerge out of the chaos
and the confusion, then what emerges is something very fabulous and exciting.
This state of alertness ó your preparedness in the present, in the field of uncertainty ó
meets with your goal and your intention and allows you to seize the opportunity. Whatís the
opportunity? Itís contained within every problem that you have in your life. Every single prob-
lem that you have in your life is the seed of an opportunity for some greater benefit. Once you
The  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success∂30

have  that  perception,  you  open  up  to  a  whole  range  of  possibilities  ó  and  this  keeps  the
mystery, the wonder, the excitement, the adventure alive.
You can look at every problem you have in your life as an opportunity for some greater
benefit. You can stay alert to opportunities by being grounded in the wisdom of uncertainty.
When your preparedness meets opportunity, the solution will spontaneously appear.
What comes out of that is often called ìgood luck.î Good luck is nothing but preparedness
and opportunity coming together. When the two are mixed together with an alert witnessing of
the chaos, a solution emerges that will be of evolutionary benefit to you and to all those that you
come into contact with. This is the perfect recipe for success, and it is based on the Law of
Detachment.
APPLYING  THE  LAW  OF  DETACHMENT
I will put the Law of Detachment into effect by making a commitment to take the following
steps:
(1)   Today I will commit myself to detachment. 1 will allow myself and those around me the
freedom to be as they are. I will not rigidly impose my idea of how things should be. I
will not force solutions on problems, thereby creating new problems. I will participate
in everything with detached involvement.
(2)   Today I will factor in uncertainty as an essential ingredient of my experience. In my
willingness to accept uncertainty, solutions will spontaneously emerge out of the prob-
lem, out of the confusion, disorder, and chaos. The more uncertain things seem to be,
the more secure I will feel, because uncertainty is my path to freedom. Through the
wisdom of uncertainty, I will find my security.
(3)   I will step into the field of all possibilities and anticipate the excitement that can occur
when I remain open to an infinity of choices. When I step into the field of all possibili-
ties, I will experience all the fun, adventure, magic, and mystery of life.

The law of
ìdharmaî or
purpose in life

Everyone has a purpose in life ... a unique gift
or special talent to give to others.
And when we blend this unique talent with ser-
vice to others, we experience the ecstasy and exulta-
tion of our own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of
all goals.
When you work you are a flute through whose
heart  the  whispering  of  the  hours  turns  to  music.
And what is it to work with love
.
 It is to weave the
cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if
your beloved were to wear that cloth. . . .
ó Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet
T
he seventh spiritual law of success is the Law of Dharma. Dharma is a Sanskrit word
that means ìpurpose in life.î The Law of Dharma says that we have taken manifes
tation in physical form to fulfill a purpose. The field of pure potentiality is divinity in
its essence, and the divine takes human form to fulfill a purpose.
According to this law, you have a unique talent and a unique way of expressing it. There is
something that you can do better than anyone else in the whole world ó and for every unique
talent and unique expression of that talent, there are also unique needs. When these needs are
matched  with  the  creative  expression  of  your  talent,  that  is  the  spark  that  creates  affluence.
Expressing your talents to fulfill needs creates unlimited wealth and abundance.
If you could start children right from the beginning with this thought, youíd see the effect it
has on their lives. In fact, I did this with my own children. Again and again, I told them there was
a reason why they were here, and they had to find out what that reason was for themselves.
From the age of four years, they heard this. I also taught them to meditate when they were
about the same age, and I told them, ìI never, ever want you to worry about making a living. If
youíre unable to make a living when you grow up, Iíll provide for you, so donít worry about that.
I donít want you to focus on doing well in school. I donít want you to focus on getting the best
grades or going to the best colleges. What I really want you to focus on is asking yourself how
you can serve humanity, and asking yourself what your unique talents are. Because you have a
unique talent that no one else has, and you have a special way of expressing that talent, and no
one else has it.î They ended up going to the best schools, getting the best grades, and even in
college, they are unique in that they are financially self-sufficient, because they are focused on
what they are here to give. This then, is the Law of Dharma.
There are three components to the Law of Dharma. The first component says that each of
us is here to discover our true Self, to find out on our own that our true Self is spiritual, that
essentially  we  are  spiritual  beings  that  have  taken  manifestation  in  physical  form.  Weíre  not
human beings that have occasional spiritual experiences ó itís the other way around: weíre
spiritual beings that have occasional human experiences.
Each of us is here to discover our higher self or our spiritual self. Thatís the first fulfillment
of the Law of Dharma. We must find out for ourself that inside us is a god or goddess in embryo
that wants to be born so that we can express our divinity.
The second component of the Law of Dharma is to express our unique talents. The Law of
Dharma says that every human being has a unique talent. You have a talent that is unique in its
33The  law  of  Dharme  or  purpose  in  life∂

expression, so unique that thereís no one else alive on this planet that has that talent, or that
expression of that talent. This means that thereís one thing you can do, and one way of doing
it, that is better than anyone else on this entire planet. When youíre doing that one thing, you
lose track of time. When youíre expressing that one unique talent that you possess ó or more
than one unique talent in many cases ó the expression of that talent takes you into timeless
awareness.
The third component of the Law of Dharma is service to humanity ó to serve your fellow
human beings and to ask yourself the questions, ìHow can I help? How can I help all those that
I come into contact with?î When you combine the ability to express your unique talent with
service  to  humanity,  then  you  make  full  use  of  the  Law  of  Dharma.  And  coupled  with  the
experience of your own spirituality, the field of pure potentiality, there is no way you will not
have access to unlimited abundance, because that is the real way abundance is achieved.
This is not a temporary abundance; itís permanent, because of your unique talent, your
way of expressing it, and your service and dedication to your fellow human beings, which you
discover through asking the question, ìHow can I help?î instead of ìWhatís in it for me?î
The question, ìWhatís in it for me?î is the internal dialogue of the ego. Asking ìHow can
I help?î is the internal dialogue of the spirit. The spirit is that domain of your awareness where
you experience your universality. In just shifting your internal dialogue from ìWhatís in it for
me?î to ìHow can I help?î you automatically go beyond the ego into the domain of your spirit.
While meditation is the most useful way of entering the domain of spirit, simply shifting your
internal dialogue to ìHow can I help?î will also access the spirit, that domain of your awareness
where you experience your universality.
If you want to make maximum use of the Law of Dharma, then you have to make several
commitments.
The  first  commitment  is:  I  am  going  to  seek  my  higher  self,  which  is  beyond  my  ego,
through spiritual practice.
The  second  commitment  is:  I  am  going  to  discover  my  unique  talents,  and  finding  my
unique talents, I am going to enjoy myself, because the process of enjoyment occurs when I go
into timeless awareness. Thatís when I am in a state of bliss.
The third commitment is: I am going to ask myself how I am best suited to serve humanity.
I am going to answer that question and then put it into practice. I am going to use my unique
talents to serve the needs of my fellow human beings ó I will match those needs to my desire to
help and serve others.
Sit down and make a list of the answers to these two questions: Ask yourself, if money was
no concern and you had all the time and money in the world, what would you do? If you would
still do what you currently do, then you are in dharma, because you have passion for what you
do ó you are expressing your unique talents. Then ask yourself: How am I best suited to serve
humanity? Answer that question, and put it into practice.
Discover your divinity, find your unique talent, serve humanity with it, and you can gener-
ate all the wealth that you want. When your creative expressions match the needs of your fellow
humans, then wealth will spontaneously flow from the unmanifest into the manifest, from the
realm of the spirit to the world of form. You will begin to experience your life as a miraculous
expression of divinity ó not just occasionally, but all the time. And you will know true joy and
the true meaning of success ó the ecstasy and exultation of your own spirit.
The  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success∂34

APPLYING THE LAW  OF ìDHARMAî  OR  PURPOSE  IN  LIFE
I   will  put  the  Law  ofDharma  into  effect  by  making  a  commitment  to  take  the  following
steps:
(1)   Today I will lovingly nurture the god or goddess in embryo that lies deep within my
soul. I will pay attention to the spirit within me that animates both my body and my
mind. I will awaken myself to this deep stillness within my heart. I will carry the con-
sciousness of timeless, eternal Being in the midst of time-bound experience.
(2)   I will make a list of my unique talents. Then I will list all the things that I love to do while
expressing my unique talents. When 1 express my unique talents and use them in the
service of humanity, I lose track of time and create abundance in my life as well as in
the lives of others.
(3)   I will ask myself daily, ìHow can I serve?î and ìHow can I help?î The answers to these
questions will allow me to help and serve my fellow human beings with love.
SUMMARY  AND  CONCLUSION
I want to know Godís thoughts...
the rest are details.
ó Albert Einstein
The universal mind choreographs everything that is happening in billions of galaxies with
elegant  precision  and  unfaltering  intelligence.  Its  intelligence  is  ultimate  and  supreme,  and  it
permeates  every  fiber  of  existence:  from  the  smallest  to  the  largest,  from  the  atom  to  the
cosmos. Everything that is alive is an expression of this intelligence. And this intelligence oper-
ates through The Seven Spiritual Laws.
If you look at any cell in the human body, you will see through its functioning the expres-
sion of these laws. Every cell, whether itís a stomach cell, or a heart cell, or a brain cell, has its
birth in the Law of Pure Potentiality. DNA is a perfect example of pure potentiality; in fact, it is
the material  expression  of  pure  potentiality.  The  same  DNA  existing  in  every  cell  expresses
itself in different ways in order to fulfill the unique requirements of that particular cell.
Each cell also operates through the Law of Giving. A cell is alive and healthy when it is in
a state of balance and equilibrium. This state of equilibrium is one of fulfillment and harmony,
but it is maintained by a constant give and take. Each cell gives to and supports every other cell,
and in turn is nourished by every other cell. The cell is always in a state of dynamic flow and the
flow is never interrupted. In fact, the flow is the very essence of the life of the cell. And only by
maintaining this flow of giving is the cell able to receive and thus continue its vibrant existence.
The Law of Karma is exquisitely executed by every cell, because built into its intelligence is
the most appropriate and precisely correct response to every situation as it occurs.
The Law of Least Effort is also exquisitely executed by every cell in the body: it does its job
with quiet efficiency in the state of restful alertness.
35The  law  of  purpose  ∂

Through the Law of Intention and Desire, every intention of every cell harnesses the infi-
nite organizing power of natureís intelligence. Even a simple intention such as metabolizing a
molecule of sugar immediately sets off a symphony of events in the body where precise amounts
of hormones have to be secreted at precise moments to convert this molecule of sugar into pure
creative energy.
Of course, every cell expresses the Law of Detachment. It is detached from the outcome of
its intentions. It doesnít stumble or falter because its behaviour is a function of life-centered,
present-moment awareness.
Each cell also expresses the Law of Dharma. Each cell must discover its own source, the
higher self; it must serve its fellow beings, and express its unique talents. Heart cells, stomach
cells, and immune cells all have their source in the higher self, the field of pure potentiality. And
because they are directly linked to this cosmic computer, they can express their unique talents
with effortless ease and timeless awareness. Only by expressing their unique talents can they
maintain both their own integrity and the integrity of the whole body. The internal dialogue of
every cell in the human body is, ìHow can I help?î The heart cells want to help the immune
cells, the immune cells want to help the stomach and lung cells, and the brain cells are listening
to and helping every other cell. Every cell in the human body has only one function: to help
every other cell.
By looking at the behaviour of the cells of our own body, we can observe the most extraor-
dinary  and  efficient  expression  of  The  Seven  Spiritual  Laws.  This  is  the  genius  of  natureís
intelligence. These are the thoughts of God ó the rest are details.
The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success are powerful principles that will enable you to attain
self-mastery. If you put your attention on these laws and practice the steps outlined in this book,
you will see that you can manifest anything you want ó all the affluence, money, and success
that you desire. You will also see that your life becomes more joyful and abundant in every way,
for these laws are also the spiritual laws of life that make living worthwhile.
There is a natural sequence for the application of these laws in your daily life that may help
you to remember them. The Law of Pure Potentiality is experienced through silence, through
meditation, through non-judgment, through communion with nature, but it is activated by the
Law  of  Giving.  The  principle  here  is  to  learn  to  give  that  which  you  seek.  Thatís  how  you
activate the Law of Pure Potentiality. If you seek affluence, give affluence; if you seek money,
give money; if you seek love, appreciation, and affection, then learn to give love, appreciation,
and affection.
Through  your  actions  in  the  Law  of  Giving  you  activate  the  Law  of  Karma. You create
good karma, and good karma makes everything in life easy. You notice that you donít have to
expend a lot of effort to fulfill your desires, which automatically leads to an understanding of the
Law  of  Least  Effort.  When  everything  is  easy  and  effortless,  and  your  desires  keep  getting
fulfilled, you spontaneously begin to understand the Law of Intention and Desire. Fulfilling your
desires with effortless ease makes it easy for you to practice the Law of Detachment.
Finally,  as  you  begin  to  understand  all  the  above  laws,  you  begin  to  focus  on  your  true
purpose in life, which leads to the Law of Dharma. Through the use of this law, by expressing
your unique talents and fulfilling the needs of your fellow humans, you begin to create whatever
you want, whenever you want it. You become carefree and joyful, and your life becomes an
expression of unbounded love.
We are travellers on a cosmic journey ó star-dust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and
whirlpools  of  infinity.  Life  is  eternal.  But  the  expressions  of  life  are  ephemeral,  momentary,
The  Seven  spiritual  laws  of  Success∂36

transient. Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, once said, This existence of ours is as
transient as autumn clouds. To watch the birth and death of beings is like looking at the move-
ments of a dance. A lifetime is like a flash of lightning in the sky, Rushing by like a torrent down
a steep mountain.
We have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share. This is
a precious moment, but it is transient. It is a little parenthesis in eternity. If we share with caring,
lightheart-edness,  and  love,  we  will  create  abundance  and  joy  for  each  other.  And  then  this
moment will have been worthwhile.

have helped me and countless others to achieve spiritual satisfaction and material success. I am
writing  to  invite  you  to  join  me,  and  potentially  millions  of  others  worldwide,  in  the  Global
Network  for  Spiritual  Success,  which  will  be  based  on  the  daily  practice  of  these  powerful
guiding principles.
Participation in the Network is open to anyone who chooses to practice The Seven Spir-
itual Laws. I have found it particularly fulfilling to concentrate on one law each day of the week,
beginning on Sunday with the Law of Pure Potentiality and concluding on Saturday with the

it has mine, and if we collectively put our attention on the same law each day, we could soon
reach a critical mass of successful people that could transform life on planet earth
With my staff and friends, I suggest starting a study group of family, friends, or co-workers
where members meet once a week to discuss their experiences with the spiritual laws.
